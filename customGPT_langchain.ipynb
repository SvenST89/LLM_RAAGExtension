      " The theory of business cycles explains the periodic fluctuations in economic activity, known as business cycles, that occur in capitalist economies. These fluctuations are caused by a combination of factors, including changes in consumer spending, investment, and interest rates. While business cycles can be severe and unstable, they tend to wear themselves out before reaching extremes and eventually reverse themselves. The theory of business cycles is based on the idea that these fluctuations are not only common but also predictable and cyclical in nature.\n"
