       "    \"Alfred Marshall, on whose Principles of Economics all contemporary English economists \\nhave been brought up, was at particular pains to emphasise the continuity of his thought \\nwith  Ricardo's.  His  work  largely  consisted  in  grafting  the  marginal  principle  and  the \\nprinciple  of  substitution  on  to  the  Ricardian  tradition;  and  his  theory  of  output  and \\nconsumption as a whole, as distinct from his theory of the production and distribution of \\na given output, was never separately expounded. Whether he himself felt the need of such \\na  theory,  I  am  not  sure.  But  his  immediate  successors  and  followers  have  certainly \\ndispensed with it and have not, apparently, felt the lack of it. It was in this atmosphere \\nthat I was brought up. I taught these doctrines myself and it is only within the last decade \\nthat  I  have  been  conscious  of  their  insufficiency.  In  my  own  thought  and  development, \\ntherefore, this book represents a reaction, a transition away from the English classical (or \\northodox) tradition. My emphasis upon this in the following pages and upon the points of \\nmy divergence from received doctrine has been regarded in some quarters in England as \\nunduly  controversial.  But  how  can  one  brought  up  a  Catholic  in  English  economics, \\nindeed a priest of that faith, avoid some controversial emphasis, when he first becomes a \\nProtestant? \\n\",\n",
       "    'But I fancy that all this may impress German readers somewhat differently. The orthodox \\ntradition,  which  ruled  in  nineteenth  century  England,  never  took  so  firm  a  hold  of \\nGerman thought. There have always existed important schools of economists in Germany \\nwho  have  strongly  disputed  the  adequacy  of  the  classical  theory  for  the  analysis  of \\ncontemporary events. The Manchester School and Marxism both derive ultimately from \\nRicardo,—a conclusion which is only superficially surprising. But in Germany there has \\nalways existed a large section of opinion which has adhered neither to the one nor to the \\nother. \\n',\n",
       "    'It  can  scarcely  be  claimed,  however,  that  this  school  of  thought  has  erected  a  rival \\ntheoretical  construction;  or  has  even  attempted  to  do  so.  It  has  been  sceptical,  realistic, \\ncontent with historical and empirical methods and results, which discard formal analysis. \\nThe most important unorthodox discussion on theoretical lines was that of Wicksell. His \\nbooks were available in German (as they were not, until lately, in English); indeed one of \\nthe  most  important  of  them  was  written  in  German.  But  his  followers  were  chiefly \\nSwedes and Austrians, the latter of whom combined his ideas with specifically Austrian \\ntheory  so  as  to  bring  them  in  effect,  back  again  towards  the  classical  tradition.  Thus \\nGermany, quite contrary to her habit in most of the sciences, has been content for a whole \\ncentury  to  do  without  any  formal  theory  of  economics  which  was  predominant  and \\ngenerally accepted. \\n',\n",
       "    \"Perhaps, therefore, I may expect less resistance from German, than from English, readers \\nin  offering  a  theory  of  employment  and  output  as  a  whole,  which  departs  in  important \\nrespects  from  the  orthodox  tradition.  But  can  I  hope  to  overcome  Germany's  economic \\nagnosticism?  Can  I  persuade  German  economists  that  methods  of  formal  analysis  have \\n\"],\n",

       "    \"Alfred Marshall, on whose Principles of Economics all contemporary English economists \\nhave been brought up, was at particular pains to emphasise the continuity of his thought \\nwith  Ricardo's.  His  work  largely  consisted  in  grafting  the  marginal  principle  and  the \\nprinciple  of  substitution  on  to  the  Ricardian  tradition;  and  his  theory  of  output  and \\nconsumption as a whole, as distinct from his theory of the production and distribution of \\na given output, was never separately expounded. Whether he himself felt the need of such \\na  theory,  I  am  not  sure.  But  his  immediate  successors  and  followers  have  certainly \\ndispensed with it and have not, apparently, felt the lack of it. It was in this atmosphere \\nthat I was brought up. I taught these doctrines myself and it is only within the last decade \\nthat  I  have  been  conscious  of  their  insufficiency.  In  my  own  thought  and  development, \\ntherefore, this book represents a reaction, a transition away from the English classical (or \\northodox) tradition. My emphasis upon this in the following pages and upon the points of \\nmy divergence from received doctrine has been regarded in some quarters in England as \\nunduly  controversial.  But  how  can  one  brought  up  a  Catholic  in  English  economics, \\nindeed a priest of that faith, avoid some controversial emphasis, when he first becomes a \\nProtestant? \\n\",\n",
       "    'But I fancy that all this may impress German readers somewhat differently. The orthodox \\ntradition,  which  ruled  in  nineteenth  century  England,  never  took  so  firm  a  hold  of \\nGerman thought. There have always existed important schools of economists in Germany \\nwho  have  strongly  disputed  the  adequacy  of  the  classical  theory  for  the  analysis  of \\ncontemporary events. The Manchester School and Marxism both derive ultimately from \\nRicardo,—a conclusion which is only superficially surprising. But in Germany there has \\nalways existed a large section of opinion which has adhered neither to the one nor to the \\nother. \\n',\n",
       "    'It  can  scarcely  be  claimed,  however,  that  this  school  of  thought  has  erected  a  rival \\ntheoretical  construction;  or  has  even  attempted  to  do  so.  It  has  been  sceptical,  realistic, \\ncontent with historical and empirical methods and results, which discard formal analysis. \\nThe most important unorthodox discussion on theoretical lines was that of Wicksell. His \\nbooks were available in German (as they were not, until lately, in English); indeed one of \\nthe  most  important  of  them  was  written  in  German.  But  his  followers  were  chiefly \\nSwedes and Austrians, the latter of whom combined his ideas with specifically Austrian \\ntheory  so  as  to  bring  them  in  effect,  back  again  towards  the  classical  tradition.  Thus \\nGermany, quite contrary to her habit in most of the sciences, has been content for a whole \\ncentury  to  do  without  any  formal  theory  of  economics  which  was  predominant  and \\ngenerally accepted. \\n',\n",

       "    \"Let me give examples of what I mean. My contention that for the system as a whole the \\namount of income which is saved, in the sense that it is not spent on current consumption, \\nis and must necessarily be exactly equal to the amount of net new investment has been \\nconsidered  a  paradox  and  has  been  the  occasion  of  widespread  controversy.  The \\nexplanation of this is undoubtedly to be found in the fact that this relationship of equality \\nbetween saving and investment, which necessarily holds good for the system as a whole, \\ndoes not hold good at all for a particular individual. There is no reason whatever why the \\nnew  investment  for  which  I  am  responsible  should  bear  any  relation  whatever  to  the \\namount  of  my  own  savings.  Quite  legitimately  we  regard  an  individual's  income  as \\nindependent  of  what  he  himself  consumes  and  invests.  But  this,  I  have  to  point  out, \\nshould  not  have  led  us  to  overlook  the  fact  that  the  demand  arising  out  of  the \\nconsumption  and  investment  of  one  individual  is  the  source  of  the  incomes  of  other \\nindividuals,  so  that  incomes  in  general  are  not  independent,  quite  the  contrary,  of  the \\ndisposition  of  individuals  to  spend  and  invest;  and  since  in  turn  the  readiness  of \\nindividuals to spend and invest depends on their incomes, a relationship is set up between \\naggregate savings and aggregate investment which can be very easily shown, beyond any \\npossibility  of  reasonable  dispute,  to  be  one  of  exact  and  necessary  equality.

My contention that for the system as a whole the \\namount of income which is saved, in the sense that it is not spent on current consumption, \\nis and must necessarily be exactly equal to the amount of net new investment has been \\nconsidered  a  paradox  and  has  been  the  occasion  of  widespread  controversy.  The \\nexplanation of this is undoubtedly to be found in the fact that this relationship of equality \\nbetween saving and investment, which necessarily holds good for the system as a whole, \\ndoes not hold good at all for a particular individual. There is no reason whatever why the \\nnew  investment  for  which  I  am  responsible  should  bear  any  relation  whatever  to  the \\namount  of  my  own  savings.

The classical theory assumes, in other words, that the \\naggregate  demand  price  (or  proceeds)  always  accommodates  itself  to  the  aggregate \\nsupply  price;  so  that,  whatever  the  value  of  N  may  be,  the  proceeds  D  assume  a  value \\nequal  to  the  aggregate  supply  price  Z  which  corresponds  to  N.  That  is  to  say,  effective \\ndemand, instead of having a unique equilibrium value, is an infinite range of values all \\nequally  admissible;  and  the  amount  of  employment  is  indeterminate  except  in  so  far  as \\nthe marginal disutility of labour sets an upper limit. \\n\",\n",
       "    \"If this were true, competition between entrepreneurs would always lead to an expansion \\nof  employment  up  to  the  point  at  which  the  supply  of  output  as  a  whole  ceases  to  be \\nelastic, i.e. where a further increase in the value of the effective demand will no longer be \\naccompanied by any increase in output. Evidently this amounts to the same thing as full \\nemployment.  In  the  previous  chapter  we  have  given  a  definition  of  full  employment  in \\nterms  of  the  behaviour  of  labour.  An  alternative,  though  equivalent,  criterion  is  that  at \\nwhich  we  have  now  arrived,  namely  a  situation  in  which  aggregate  employment  is \\ninelastic in response to an increase in the effective demand for its output. Thus Say's law, \\nthat the aggregate demand price of output as a whole is equal to its aggregate supply price \\nfor all volumes of output, is equivalent to the proposition that there is no obstacle to full \\nemployment.  If,  however,  this  is  not  the  true  law  relating  the  aggregate  demand  and \\nsupply functions, there is a vitally important chapter of economic theory which remains \\nto  be  written  and  without  which  all  discussions  concerning  the  volume  of  aggregate \\nemployment are futile. \\n\",\n",

We  will  first  suppose  that  the  change  is  of  such  a  character  that  the  new \\nlong-period employment will be greater than the old. Now, as a rule, it will only be the \\nrate of input which will be much affected at the beginning, that is to say, the volume of \\nwork  on  the  earlier  stages  of  new  processes  of  production,  whilst  the  output  of \\nconsumption-goods and the amount of employment on the later stages of processes which \\nwere  started  before  the  change  will  remain  much  the  same  as  before.  In  so  far  as  there \\nwere stocks of partly finished goods, this conclusion may be modified; though it is likely \\nto remain true that the initial increase in employment will be modest. As, however, the \\ndays  pass  by,  employment  will  gradually  increase.  Moreover,  it  is  easy  to  conceive  of \\nconditions  which  will  cause  it  to  increase  at  some  stage  to  a  higher  level  than  the  new \\nlong-period employment. For the process of building up capital to satisfy the new state of \\nexpectation  may  lead  to  more  employment  and  also  to  more  current  consumption  than \\nwill  occur  when  the  long-period  position  has  been  reached.

In  so  far  as  there \\nwere stocks of partly finished goods, this conclusion may be modified; though it is likely \\nto remain true that the initial increase in employment will be modest. As, however, the \\ndays  pass  by,  employment  will  gradually  increase.  Moreover,  it  is  easy  to  conceive  of \\nconditions  which  will  cause  it  to  increase  at  some  stage  to  a  higher  level  than  the  new \\nlong-period employment.

For  no  unique  principle  can  be \\nestablished for the estimation of supplementary cost, and its amount will depend on our \\nchoice of an accounting method. The expected value of the supplementary cost, when the \\nequipment  was  originally  produced,  is  a  definite  quantity.  But  if  it  is  re-estimated \\nsubsequently,  its  amount  over  the  remainder  of  the  life  of  the  equipment  may  have \\nchanged as a result of a change in the meantime in our expectations; the windfall capital \\nloss  being  the  discounted  value  of  the  difference  between  the  former  and  the  revised \\nexpectation  of  the  prospective  series  of  U  +  V.  It  is  a  widely  approved  principle  of \\nbusiness accounting, endorsed by the Inland Revenue authorities, to establish a figure for \\nthe sum of the supplementary cost and the user cost when the equipment is acquired and \\nto  maintain  this  unaltered  during  the  life  of  the  equipment,  irrespective  of  subsequent \\nchanges in expectation. In this case the supplementary cost over any period must be taken \\nas  the  excess  of  this  predetermined  figure  over  the  actual  user  cost.  This  has  the \\nadvantage  of  ensuring  that  the  windfall  gain  or  loss  shall  be  zero  over  the  life  of  the \\nequipment  taken  as  a  whole.  But  it  is  also  reasonable  in  certain  circumstances  to \\nrecalculate  the  allowance  for  supplementary  cost  on  the  basis  of  current  values  and \\nexpectations at an arbitrary accounting interval, e.g. annually. Business men in fact differ \\nas  to  which  course  they  adopt.  It  may  be  convenient  to  call  the  initial  expectation  of \\nsupplementary  cost  when  the  equipment  is  first  acquired  the  basic  supplementary  cost, \\nand  the  same  quantity  recalculated  up  to  date  on  the  basis  of  current  values  and \\nexpectations the current supplementary cost. \\n',\n",

It is the \\nexcess  of  the  proceeds  of  the  current  output  over  the  sum  of  the  prime  cost  and  the \\nsupplementary  cost  which  is  relevant  to  the  entrepreneur's  consumption;  whereas, \\nalthough the windfall loss (or gain) enters into his decisions, it does not enter into them \\non  the  same  scale—a  given  windfall  loss  does  not  have  the  same  effect  as  an  equal \\nsupplementary cost. \\n\",\n",
       "    'We must now recur, however, to the point that the line between supplementary costs and \\nwindfall losses, i.e. between those unavoidable losses which we think it proper to debit to \\nincome account and those which it is reasonable to reckon as a windfall loss (or gain) on \\ncapital account, is partly a conventional or psychological one, depending on what are the \\ncommonly  accepted  criteria  for  estimating  the  former.  For  no  unique  principle  can  be \\nestablished for the estimation of supplementary cost, and its amount will depend on our \\nchoice of an accounting method. The expected value of the supplementary cost, when the \\nequipment  was  originally  produced,  is  a  definite  quantity.  But  if  it  is  re-estimated \\nsubsequently,  its  amount  over  the  remainder  of  the  life  of  the  equipment  may  have \\nchanged as a result of a change in the meantime in our expectations; the windfall capital \\nloss  being  the  discounted  value  of  the  difference  between  the  former  and  the  revised \\nexpectation  of  the  prospective  series  of  U  +  V.  It  is  a  widely  approved  principle  of \\nbusiness accounting, endorsed by the Inland Revenue authorities, to establish a figure for \\nthe sum of the supplementary cost and the user cost when the equipment is acquired and \\nto  maintain  this  unaltered  during  the  life  of  the  equipment,  irrespective  of  subsequent \\nchanges in expectation. In this case the supplementary cost over any period must be taken \\nas  the  excess  of  this  predetermined  figure  over  the  actual  user  cost.  This  has  the \\nadvantage  of  ensuring  that  the  windfall  gain  or  loss  shall  be  zero  over  the  life  of  the \\nequipment  taken  as  a  whole.  But  it  is  also  reasonable  in  certain  circumstances  to \\nrecalculate  the  allowance  for  supplementary  cost  on  the  basis  of  current  values  and \\nexpectations at an arbitrary accounting interval, e.g. annually. Business men in fact differ \\nas  to  which  course  they  adopt.  It  may  be  convenient  to  call  the  initial  expectation  of \\nsupplementary  cost  when  the  equipment  is  first  acquired  the  basic  supplementary  cost, \\nand  the  same  quantity  recalculated  up  to  date  on  the  basis  of  current  values  and \\nexpectations the current supplementary cost. \\n',\n",
       "    'Thus we cannot get closer to a quantitative definition of supplementary cost than that it \\ncomprises those deductions from his income which a typical entrepreneur makes before \\nreckoning what he considers his net income for the purpose of declaring a dividend (in \\nthe case of a corporation) or of deciding the scale of his current consumption (in the case \\nof an individual). Since windfall charges on capital account are not going to be ruled out \\nof the picture, it is clearly better, in case of doubt, to assign an item to capital account, \\n']],\n",

For, \\neven  if  we  assume  that  the  marginal  cost  of  purchases  from  other  firms  involved  in \\nselling an additional unit of output has to be deducted from the sale-proceeds per unit in \\norder to give us what we mean by our firm's supply price, we still have to allow for the \\nmarginal disinvestment in the firm's own equipment involved in producing the marginal \\noutput.  Even  if  all  production  is  carried  on  by  a  completely  integrated  firm,  it  is  still \\nillegitimate  to  suppose  that  the  marginal  user  cost  is  zero,  i.e.  that  the  marginal \\ndisinvestment in equipment due to the production of the marginal output can generally be \\nneglected. \\n\",\n",
       "    \"The concepts of user cost and of supplementary cost also enable us to establish a clearer \\nrelationship between long-period supply price and short-period supply price. Long-period \\ncost must obviously include an amount to cover the basic supplementary cost as well as \\nthe expected prime cost appropriately averaged over the life of the equipment. That is to \\nsay, the long-period cost of the output is equal to the expected sum of the prime cost and \\nthe  supplementary  cost;  and,  furthermore,  in  order  to  yield  a  normal  profit,  the  long-\\nperiod  supply  price  must  exceed  the  long-period  cost  thus  calculated  by  an  amount \\ndetermined by the current rate of interest on loans of comparable term and risk, reckoned \\nas a percentage of the cost of the equipment. Or if we prefer to take a standard 'pure' rate \\nof interest, we must include in the long-period cost a third term which we might call the \\nrisk-cost  to  cover  the  unknown  possibilities  of  the  actual  yield  differing  from  the \\nexpected yield. Thus the long-period supply price is equal to the sum of the prime cost, \\nthe supplementary cost, the risk cost and the interest cost, into which several components \\nit  can  be  analysed.  The  short-period  supply  price,  on  the  other  hand,  is  equal  to  the \\nmarginal  prime  cost.  The  entrepreneur  must,  therefore,  expect,  when  he  buys  or \\nconstructs  his equipment, to  cover his supplementary cost, his risk cost and his interest \\ncost out of the excess of the marginal value of the prime cost over its average value; so \\nthat  in  long-period  equilibrium  the  excess  of  the  marginal  prime  cost  over  the  average \\nprime cost is equal to the sum of the supplementary, risk and interest costs[1]. \\n\",\n",

In  an  historical  enquiry  or  in  comparing  one  social \\nsystem with another of a different type, it is necessary to take account of the manner in \\nwhich  changes  in  the  subjective  factors  may  affect  the  propensity  to  consume.  But,  in \\ngeneral,  we  shall  in  what  follows  take  the  subjective  factors  as  given;  and  we  shall \\nassume that the propensity to consume depends only on changes in the objective factors. \\n',\n",

In a given state of technique and tastes \\nand of social conditions determining the distribution of income, a man's real income will \\nrise and fall with the amount of his command over labour-units, i.e. with the amount of \\nhis  income  measured  in  wage-units;  though  when  the  aggregate  volume  of  output \\nchanges, his real income will (owing to the operation of decreasing returns) rise less than \\nin proportion to his income measured in wage-units. As a first approximation, therefore, \\nwe can reasonably assume that, if the wage-unit changes, the expenditure on consumption \\ncorresponding  to  a  given  level  of  employment  will,  like  prices,  change  in  the  same \\nproportion;  though  in  some  circumstances  we  may  have  to  make  an  allowance  for  the \\npossible reactions on aggregate consumption of the change in the distribution of a given \\nreal income between entrepreneurs and rentiers resulting from a change in the wage-unit. \\nApart  from  this,  we  have  already  allowed  for  changes  in  the  wage-unit  by  defining  the \\npropensity to consume in terms of income measured in terms of wage-units. \\n\",\n",
       "    '(2)  A  change  in  the  difference  between  income  and  net  income.  We  have  shown  above \\nthat the amount of consumption depends on net income rather than on income, since it is, \\nby  definition,  his  net  income  that  a  man  has primarily  in mind when he  is deciding his \\nscale  of  consumption.

For  a  man's  habitual  standard  of  life  usually  has  the \\nfirst  claim  on  his  income,  and  he  is  apt  to  save  the  difference  which  discovers  itself \\nbetween his actual income and the expense of his habitual standard; or, if he does adjust \\nhis  expenditure  to  changes  in  his  income,  he  will  over  short  periods  do  so  imperfectly. \\nThus  a  rising  income  will  often  be  accompanied  by  increased  saving,  and  a  falling \\nincome by decreased saving, on a greater scale at first than subsequently. \\n\",\n",

For  the  satisfaction  of  the  immediate  primary  needs  of  a  man  and  his \\nfamily is usually  a stronger  motive  than the motives towards accumulation, which only \\nacquire effective sway when a margin of comfort has been attained.

'The  difficulty',  he  writes,  'of  passing \\nfrom  gross  to  net  capital  formation,  that  is,  the  difficulty  of  correcting  for  the \\nconsumption  of  existing  durable  commodities,  is  not  only  in  the  lack  of  data.  The  very \\nconcept of annual consumption of commodities that last over a number of years suffers \\nfrom  ambiguity'[7].  He  falls  back,  therefore,  'on  the  assumption  that  the  allowance  for \\ndepreciation and depletion on the books of business firms describes correctly the volume \\nof  consumption  of  already  existing,  finished  durable  goods  used  by  business  firms'  On \\nthe  other  hand,  he  attempts  no  deduction  at  all  in  respect  of  houses  and  other  durable \\ncommodities in the hands of individuals. His very interesting results for the United States \\ncan be summarised as follows: \\n\",\n",

Thus  gold-mines  are  of  the  greatest  value  and  importance  to \\ncivilisation. Just as wars have been the only form of large-scale loan expenditure which \\nstatesmen have thought justifiable, so gold-mining is the only pretext for digging holes in \\nthe ground which has recommended itself to bankers as sound finance; and each of these \\nactivities has played its part in progress—failing something better. To mention a detail, \\nthe tendency in slumps for the price of gold to rise in terms of labour and materials aids \\neventual recovery, because it increases the depth at which gold-digging pays and lowers \\nthe minimum grade of ore which is payable. \\n',\n",
       "    'In  addition  to  the  probable  effect  of  increased  supplies  of  gold  on  the  rate  of  interest, \\ngold-mining is for two reasons a highly practical form of investment, if we are precluded \\nfrom  increasing  employment  by  means  which  at  the  same  time  increase  our  stock  of \\nuseful  wealth.  In  the  first  place,  owing  to  the  gambling  attractions  which  it  offers  it  is \\ncarried on without too close a regard to the ruling rate of interest. In the second place the \\nresult, namely, the increased stock of gold, does not, as in other cases, have the effect of \\ndiminishing its marginal utility. Since the value of a house depends on its utility, every \\nhouse  which  is  built  serves  to  diminish  the  prospective  rents  obtainable  from  further \\nhouse-building  and  therefore  lessens  the  attraction  of  further  similar  investment  unless \\nthe rate of interest is falling pari passu. But the fruits of gold-mining do not suffer from \\nthis disadvantage, and a check can only come through a rise of the wage-unit in terms of \\ngold,  which  is  not  likely  to  occur  unless  and  until  employment  is  substantially  better. \\nMoreover,  there  is  no  subsequent  reverse  effect  on  account  of  provision  for  user  and \\nsupplementary costs, as in the case of less durable forms of wealth. \\n',\n",

A collapse in the price of equities, which has had disastrous reactions on \\nthe  marginal  efficiency  of  capital,  may  have  been  due  to  the  weakening  either  of \\nspeculative  confidence  or of  the  state  of  credit.  But  whereas  the  weakening  of  either  is \\nenough  to  cause  a  collapse,  recovery  requires  the  revival  of  both.  For  whilst  the \\nweakening  of  credit  is  sufficient  to  bring  about  a  collapse,  its  strengthening,  though  a \\nnecessary condition of recovery, is not a sufficient condition. \\n',\n",

If  I  may  be  allowed  to  appropriate  the  term \\nspeculation  for  the  activity  of  forecasting  the  psychology  of  the  market,  and  the  term \\nenterprise for the activity of forecasting the prospective yield of assets over their whole \\nlife, it is by no means always the case that speculation predominates over enterprise. As \\nthe  organisation  of  investment  markets  improves,  the  risk  of  the  predominance  of \\nspeculation  does,  however,  increase.  In  one  of  the  greatest  investment  markets  in  the \\nworld, namely, New York, the influence of speculation (in the above sense) is enormous. \\nEven  outside  the  field  of  finance,  Americans  are  apt  to  be  unduly  interested  in \\ndiscovering  what  average  opinion  believes  average  opinion  to  be;  and  this  national \\nweakness finds its nemesis in the stock market. It is rare, one is told, for an American to \\ninvest,  as  many  Englishmen  still  do,  'for  income';  and  he  will  not  readily  purchase  an \\ninvestment except in the hope of capital appreciation. This is only another way of saying \\nthat, when he purchases an investment, the American is attaching his hopes, not so much \\nto its prospective yield, as to a favourable change in the conventional basis of valuation, \\ni.e. that he is, in the above sense, a speculator. Speculators may do no harm as bubbles on \\na  steady  stream  of  enterprise.  But  the  position  is  serious  when  enterprise  becomes  the \\nbubble  on  a  whirlpool  of  speculation.  When  the  capital  development  of  a  country \\nbecomes  a  by-product  of  the  activities  of  a  casino,  the  job  is  likely  to  be  ill-done.

       "    '(5)  So  far  we  have  had  chiefly  in  mind  the  state  of  confidence  of  the  speculator  or \\nspeculative  investor  himself  and  may  have  seemed  to  be  tacitly  assuming  that,  if  he \\nhimself  is  satisfied  with  the  prospects,  he  has  unlimited  command  over  money  at  the \\nmarket rate of interest. This is, of course, not the case. Thus we must also take account of \\nthe  other  facet  of  the  state  of  confidence,  namely,  the  confidence  of  the  lending \\ninstitutions  towards  those  who  seek  to  borrow  from  them,  sometimes  described  as  the \\nstate of credit. A collapse in the price of equities, which has had disastrous reactions on \\nthe  marginal  efficiency  of  capital,  may  have  been  due  to  the  weakening  either  of \\nspeculative  confidence  or of  the  state  of  credit.  But  whereas  the  weakening  of  either  is \\nenough  to  cause  a  collapse,  recovery  requires  the  revival  of  both.  For  whilst  the \\nweakening  of  credit  is  sufficient  to  bring  about  a  collapse,  its  strengthening,  though  a \\nnecessary condition of recovery, is not a sufficient condition. \\n',\n",

       "    \"These considerations should not lie beyond the purview of the economist. But they must \\nbe  relegated  to  their  right  perspective.  If  I  may  be  allowed  to  appropriate  the  term \\nspeculation  for  the  activity  of  forecasting  the  psychology  of  the  market,  and  the  term \\nenterprise for the activity of forecasting the prospective yield of assets over their whole \\nlife, it is by no means always the case that speculation predominates over enterprise. As \\nthe  organisation  of  investment  markets  improves,  the  risk  of  the  predominance  of \\nspeculation  does,  however,  increase.  In  one  of  the  greatest  investment  markets  in  the \\nworld, namely, New York, the influence of speculation (in the above sense) is enormous. \\nEven  outside  the  field  of  finance,  Americans  are  apt  to  be  unduly  interested  in \\ndiscovering  what  average  opinion  believes  average  opinion  to  be;  and  this  national \\nweakness finds its nemesis in the stock market. It is rare, one is told, for an American to \\ninvest,  as  many  Englishmen  still  do,  'for  income';  and  he  will  not  readily  purchase  an \\ninvestment except in the hope of capital appreciation. This is only another way of saying \\nthat, when he purchases an investment, the American is attaching his hopes, not so much \\nto its prospective yield, as to a favourable change in the conventional basis of valuation, \\ni.e. that he is, in the above sense, a speculator. Speculators may do no harm as bubbles on \\na  steady  stream  of  enterprise.  But  the  position  is  serious  when  enterprise  becomes  the \\nbubble  on  a  whirlpool  of  speculation.  When  the  capital  development  of  a  country \\nbecomes  a  by-product  of  the  activities  of  a  casino,  the  job  is  likely  to  be  ill-done.  The \\nmeasure  of  success  attained  by  Wall  Street[5],  regarded  as  an  institution  of  which  the \\nproper  social  purpose  is  to  direct  new  investment  into  the  most  profitable  channels  in \\nterms  of  future  yield,  cannot  be  claimed  as  one  of  the  outstanding  triumphs  of  laissez-\\nfaire capitalism—which is not surprising, if I am right in thinking that the best brains of \\nWall Street have been in fact directed towards a different object. \\n\",\n",

Moreover it is impossible for the actual amount of hoarding \\nto  change  as  a  result  of  decisions  on  the  part  of  the  public,  so  long  as  we  mean  by \\n'hoarding'  the  actual  holding  of  cash.  For  the  amount  of  hoarding  must  be  equal  to  the \\nquantity  of  money  (or—on  some  definitions—to  the  quantity  of  money  minus  what  is \\nrequired to satisfy the transactions-motive); and the quantity of money is not determined \\nby  the  public.  All  that  the  propensity  of  the  public  towards  hoarding  can  achieve  is  to \\ndetermine the rate of interest at which the aggregate desire to hoard becomes equal to the \\navailable  cash.  The  habit  of  overlooking  the  relation  of  the  rate  of  interest  to  hoarding \\nmay be a part of the explanation why interest has been usually regarded as the reward of \\nnot-spending, whereas in fact it is the reward of not-hoarding. \\n\",\n",
       "    '1.  Without  disturbance  to  this  definition,  we  can  draw  the  line  between  “money”  and  “debts”  at \\nwhatever point is most convenient for handling a particular problem. For example, we can treat as \\nmoney any command over general purchasing power which the owner has not parted with for a \\nperiod in excess of three months, and as debt what cannot be recovered for a longer period than \\nthis; or we can substitute for “three months” one month or three days or three hours or any other \\nperiod;  or  we  can  exclude  from  money  whatever  is  not  legal  tender  on  the  spot.  It  is  often \\nconvenient in practice to include in money time-deposits with banks and, occasionally, even such \\ninstruments  as  (e.g.)  treasury  bills.  As  a  rule,  I  shall,  as  in  my  Treatise  on  Money,  assume  that \\nmoney is coextensive with bank deposits. \\n',\n",

In general discussion, as distinct from specific problems where the period of the debt is expressly \\nspecified,  it  is  convenient  to  mean  by  the  rate  of  interest  the  complex  of  the  various  rates  of \\ninterest current for different periods of time, i.e. for debts of different maturities. \\n',\n",

He  has  a  sufficient  reason  for  holding  cash  or  debts  in \\npreference to equities; but the purchase of debts will be a preferable alternative to holding cash, \\nunless he also  believes that the  future  rate  of  interest will  prove  to be  higher  than the  market is \\nsupposing. \\n',\n",

       "    \"'The interest of money is not regulated by the rate at which the Bank will lend, whether it \\nbe 5, 3 or 2 per cent., but by the rate of profit which can be made by the employment of \\ncapital,  and  which  is  totally  independent  of  the  quantity  or  of  the  value  of  money. \\nWhether the Bank lent one million, ten millions, or a hundred millions, they would not \\npermanently  alter  the  market  rate  of  interest;  they  would  alter  only  the  value  of  the \\nmoney  which  they  thus  issued.  In  one  case,  ten  or  twenty  times  more  money  might  be \\nrequired  to  carry  on  the  same  business  than  what  might  be  required  in  the  other.  The \\napplications to the Bank for money, then, depend on the comparison between the rate of \\nprofits that may be made by the employment of it, and the rate at which they are willing \\nto lend it. If they charge less than the market rate of interest, there is no amount of money \\nwhich they might not lend;—if they charge more than that rate, none but spendthrifts and \\nprodigals would be found to borrow of them.' \\n\",\n",
       "    \"This is so clear-cut that it affords a better starting-point for a discussion than the phrases \\nof later writers who, without really departing from the essence of the Ricardian doctrine, \\nare nevertheless sufficiently uncomfortable about it to seek refuge in haziness. The above \\nis, of course, as always with Ricardo, to be interpreted as a long-period doctrine, with the \\nemphasis on the word 'permanently' half-way through the passage; and it is interesting to \\nconsider the assumptions required to validate it. \\n\",\n",
       "    'Once again the assumption required is the usual classical assumption, that there is always \\nfull employment; so that, assuming no change in the supply curve of labour in terms of \\nproduct, there is only one possible level of employment in  long-period equilibrium. On \\nthis  assumption  with  the  usual  ceteris  paribus,  i.e.  no  change  in  psychological \\npropensities and expectations other than those arising out of a change in the quantity of \\nmoney, the Ricardian theory is valid, in the sense that on these suppositions there is only \\none  rate  of  interest  which  will  be  compatible  with  full  employment  in  the  long  period. \\nRicardo and his successors overlook the fact that even in the long period the volume of \\nemployment is not necessarily full but is capable of varying, and that to every banking \\npolicy there corresponds a different long-period level of employment; so that there are a \\nnumber  of  positions  of  long-period  equilibrium  corresponding  to  different  conceivable \\ninterest policies on the part of the monetary authority. \\n',\n",

In \\neffect he attempts to deduct “from the floating credit handed over to business men through credit \\ncreations the floating capital which would have been contributed in other ways if the banks had \\nnot been there”. After these deductions have been made, the argument is one of deep obscurity. To \\nbegin with, the rentiers have an income of 1500, of which they consume 500 and save 1000; the act \\nof credit creation reduces their income to 1300, of which they consume 500 - x and save 800 + x; \\nand  x,  Prof.  Pigou  concludes,  represents  the  net  increase  of  capital  made  available  by  the  act  of \\ncredit  creation.  Is  the  entrepreneurs’  income  supposed  to  be  swollen  by  the  amount  which  they \\nborrow from the banks (after making the above deductions)? Or is it swollen by the amount, i.e. \\n200, by which the rentiers’ income is reduced? In either case, are they supposed to save the whole \\nof it? Is the increased investment equal to the credit creations minus the deductions? Or is it equal \\nto x? The argument seems to stop just where it should begin. \\n',\n",

This reference (op. cit. pp. 129-134) contains Prof. Pigou’s view as to the amount by which a new \\ncredit  creation  by  the  banks  increases  the  stream  of  real  capital  available  for  entrepreneurs.  In \\neffect he attempts to deduct “from the floating credit handed over to business men through credit \\ncreations the floating capital which would have been contributed in other ways if the banks had \\nnot been there”. After these deductions have been made, the argument is one of deep obscurity. To \\nbegin with, the rentiers have an income of 1500, of which they consume 500 and save 1000; the act \\nof credit creation reduces their income to 1300, of which they consume 500 - x and save 800 + x; \\nand  x,  Prof.  Pigou  concludes,  represents  the  net  increase  of  capital  made  available  by  the  act  of \\ncredit  creation.  Is  the  entrepreneurs’  income  supposed  to  be  swollen  by  the  amount  which  they \\nborrow from the banks (after making the above deductions)? Or is it swollen by the amount, i.e. \\n200, by which the rentiers’ income is reduced? In either case, are they supposed to save the whole \\nof it? Is the increased investment equal to the credit creations minus the deductions? Or is it equal \\nto x? The argument seems to stop just where it should begin. \\n',\n",

Where,  however,  (as  in  the  United  States,  1933−1934)  open-market  operations \\nhave been limited to the purchase of very short-dated securities, the effect may, of course, \\nbe mainly confined to the very short-term rate of interest and have but little reaction on \\nthe much more important long-term rates of interest. \\n',\n",
       "    'In  dealing  with  the  speculative-motive  it  is,  however,  important  to  distinguish  between \\nthe  changes  in  the  rate  of  interest  which  are  due  to  changes  in  the  supply  of  money \\navailable to satisfy the speculative-motive, without there having been any change in the \\nliquidity function, and those which are primarily due to changes in expectation affecting \\nthe  liquidity  function  itself.  Open-market  Operations  may,  indeed,  influence  the  rate  of \\ninterest through both channels; since they may not only change the volume of money, but \\nmay  also  give  rise  to  changed  expectations  concerning  the  future  policy  of  the  central \\nbank or of the government. Changes in the liquidity function itself; due to a change in the \\nnews  which  causes  revision  of  expectations,  will  often  be  discontinuous,  and  will, \\ntherefore, give rise to a corresponding discontinuity of change in the rate of interest. Only, \\nindeed,  in  so  far  as  the  change  in  the  news  is  differently  interpreted  by  different \\nindividuals or affects individual interests differently will there be room for any increased \\nactivity of dealing in the bond market. If the change in the news affects the judgment and \\nthe requirements of everyone in precisely the same way, the rate of interest (as indicated \\nby the prices of bonds and debts) will be adjusted forthwith to the new situation without \\nany market transactions being necessary. \\n',\n",
       "    'Thus,  in  the  simplest  case,  where  everyone  is  similar  and  similarly  placed,  a  change  in \\ncircumstances or expectations will not be capable of causing any displacement of money \\nwhatever;—it will simply change the rate of interest in whatever degree is necessary to \\noffset the desire of each individual, felt at the previous rate, to change his holding of cash \\nin response to the new circumstances or expectations; and, since everyone will change his \\nideas  as  to  the  rate  which  would  induce  him  to  alter  his  holdings  of  cash  in  the  same \\ndegree,  no  transactions  will  result.  To  each  set  of  circumstances  and  expectations  there \\nwill  correspond  an  appropriate  rate  of  interest,  and  there  will  never  be  any  question  of \\nanyone changing his usual holdings of cash. \\n',\n",

Thus  the  new  equilibrium  rate  of  interest  will  be \\nassociated  with  a  redistribution  of  money-holdings.  Nevertheless  it  is  the  change  in  the \\nrate of interest, rather than the redistribution of cash, which deserves our main attention. \\nThe  latter  is  incidental  to  individual  differences,  whereas  the  essential  phenomenon  is \\nthat which occurs in the simplest case. Moreover, even in the general case, the shift in the \\nrate of interest is usually the most prominent part of the reaction to a change in the news. \\nThe  movement  in  bond-prices  is,  as  the  newspapers  are  accustomed  to  say,  'out  of  all \\nproportion  to  the  activity  of  dealing';—which  is  as  it  should  be,  in  view  of  individuals \\nbeing much more similar than they are dissimilar in their reaction to news. \\n\"]],\n",

But  the  long-term  rate  may  be  more \\nrecalcitrant when once it has fallen to a level which, on the basis of past experience and \\npresent  expectations  of  future  monetary  policy,  is  considered  'unsafe'  by  representative \\nopinion.  For  example,  in  a  country  linked  to  an  international  gold  standard,  a  rate  of \\ninterest  lower  than  prevails  elsewhere  will  be  viewed  with  a  justifiable  lack  of \\nconfidence;  yet  a  domestic  rate  of  interest  dragged  up  to  a  parity  with  the  highest  rate \\n(highest after allowing for risk) prevailing in any country belonging to the international \\nsystem may be much higher than is consistent with domestic full employment. \\n\",\n",

Any level of interest which is \\naccepted  with  sufficient  conviction  as  likely  to  be  durable  will  be  durable;  subject,  of \\ncourse, in a changing society to fluctuations for all kinds of reasons round the expected \\nnormal. In particular, when M1 is increasing faster than M, the rate of interest will rise, \\nand  vice  versa.  But  it  may  fluctuate  for  decades  about  a  level  which  is  chronically  too \\nhigh  for  full  employment;—particularly  if  it  is  the  prevailing  opinion  that  the  rate  of \\ninterest  is  self-adjusting,  so  that  the  level  established  by  convention  is  thought  to  be \\nrooted in objective grounds much stronger than convention, the failure of employment to \\nattain an optimum level being in no way associated, in the minds either of the public or of \\nauthority, with the prevalence of an inappropriate range of rates of interest. \\n',\n",

It  is  preferable  to  regard  labour,  including,  of  course,  the \\npersonal services of the entrepreneur and his assistants, as the sole factor of production, \\noperating in a given environment of technique, natural resources, capital equipment and \\neffective demand.

Lengthy  processes  are  not  physically  efficient  because  they  are \\nlong.  Some,  probably  most,  lengthy  processes  would  be  physically  very  inefficient,  for \\nthere are such things as spoiling or wasting with time[1]. With a given labour force there is \\na definite limit to the quantity of labour embodied in roundabout processes which can be \\nused  to  advantage.  Apart  from  other  considerations,  there  must  be  a  due  proportion \\nbetween the amount of labour employed in making machines and the amount which will \\nbe employed in using them. The ultimate quantity of value will not increase indefinitely, \\nrelatively to the quantity of labour employed, as the processes adopted become more and \\nmore roundabout, even if their physical efficiency is still increasing. Only if the desire to \\npostpone  consumption  were  strong  enough  to  produce  a  situation  in  which  full \\nemployment required a volume of investment so great as to involve a negative marginal \\nefficiency  of  capital,  would  a  process  become  advantageous  merely  because  it  was \\nlengthy; in which event we should employ physically inefficient processes, provided they \\nwere sufficiently lengthy for the gain from postponement to outweigh their inefficiency. \\nWe  should  in  fact  have  a  situation  in  which  short  processes  would  have  to  be  kept \\nsufficiently scarce for their physical efficiency to outweigh the disadvantage of the early \\ndelivery of their product. A correct theory, therefore, must be reversible so as to be able \\nto cover the eases of the marginal efficiency of capital corresponding either to a positive \\nor to a negative rate of interest; and it is, I think, only the scarcity theory outlined above \\nwhich is capable of this. \\n',\n",

The  convenience  of  holding  assets  in  the  same  standard  as  that  in \\nwhich future liabilities may fall due and in a standard in terms of which the future cost of \\nliving is expected to be relatively stable, is obvious.

       "   ['It  may  be  that  in  certain  historic  environments  the  possession  of  land  has  been \\ncharacterised  by  a  high  liquidity-premium  in  the  minds  of  owners  of  wealth;  and  since \\nland resembles money in that its elasticities of production and substitution may be very \\nlow[8],  it  is  conceivable  that  there  have  been  occasions  in  history  in  which  the  desire  to \\nhold land has played the same role in keeping up the rate of interest at too high a level \\nwhich  money  has  played  in  recent  times.  It  is  difficult  to  trace  this  influence \\nquantitatively owing to the absence of a forward price for land in terms of itself which is \\nstrictly  comparable  with  the  rate  of  interest  on  a  money  debt.  We  have,  however, \\nsomething  which  has,  at  times,  been  closely  analogous,  in  the  shape  of  high  rates  of \\ninterest  on  mortgages[9].  The  high  rates  of  interest  from  mortgages  on  land,  often \\nexceeding the probable net yield from cultivating the land, have been a familiar feature of \\nmany  agricultural  economies.  Usury  laws  have  been  directed  primarily  against \\nencumbrances of this character. And rightly so. For in earlier social organisation where \\nlong-term  bonds  in  the  modern  sense  were  non-existent,  the  competition  of  a  high \\ninterest-rate on mortgages may well have had the same effect in retarding the growth of \\nwealth from current investment in newly produced capital-assets, as high interest rates on \\nlong-term debts have had in more recent times. \\n',\n",
       "    'That  the  world  after  several  millennia  of  steady  individual  saving,  is  so  poor  as  it  is  in \\naccumulated capital-assets, is to be explained, in my opinion, neither by the improvident \\npropensities  of  mankind,  nor  even  by  the  destruction  of  war,  but  by  the  high  liquidity-\\npremiums  formerly  attaching  to  the  ownership  of  land  and  now  attaching  to  money.

I  believed  this  to  be  a  development  and  clarification  of  Wicksell's \\n'natural rate of interest', which was, according to him, the rate which would preserve the \\nstability of some, not quite clearly specified, price-level. \\n\",\n",

In  any \\ngiven industry we have a demand schedule for the product relating the quantities which \\ncan be sold to the prices asked; we have a series of supply schedules relating the prices \\nwhich will be asked for the sale of different quantities on various bases of cost; and these \\nschedules between them lead up to a further schedule which, on the assumption that other \\ncosts  are  unchanged  (except  as  a  result  of  the  change  in  output),  gives  us  the  demand \\nschedule for labour in the industry relating the quantity of employment to different levels \\nof  wages,  the  shape  of  the  curve  at  any  point  furnishing  the  elasticity  of  demand  for \\nlabour. This conception is then transferred without substantial modification to industry as \\na whole; and it is supposed, by a parity of reasoning, that we have a demand schedule for \\nlabour in industry as a whole relating the quantity of employment to  different  levels of \\nwages.  It  is  held  that  it  makes  no  material  difference  to  this  argument  whether  it  is  in \\nterms of money-wages or of real wages. If we are thinking in terms of money-wages, we \\nmust,  of  course,  correct  for  changes  in  the  value  of  money;  but  this  leaves  the  general \\ntendency  of  the  argument  unchanged,  since  prices  certainly  do  not  change  in  exact \\nproportion to changes in money-wages. \\n',\n",
       "    \"If  this  is  the  groundwork  of  the  argument  (and,  if  it  is  not,  I  do  not  know  what  the \\ngroundwork is), surely it is fallacious. For the demand schedules for particular industries \\ncan  only  be  constructed  on  some  fixed  assumption  as  to  the  nature  of  the  demand  and \\nsupply  schedules  of  other  industries  and  as  to  the  amount  of  the  aggregate  effective \\ndemand. It is invalid, therefore, to transfer the argument to industry as a whole unless we \\nalso  transfer  our  assumption  that  the  aggregate  effective  demand  is  fixed.  Yet  this \\nassumption reduces the argument to an ignoratio elenchi. For, whilst no one would wish \\nto  deny  the  proposition  that  a  reduction  in  money-wages  accompanied  by  the  same \\naggregate effective demand as before will be associated with an increase in employment, \\nthe precise question at issue is whether the reduction in money-wages will or will not be \\naccompanied by the same aggregate effective demand as before measured in money, or, \\nat any rate, by an aggregate effective demand which is not reduced in full proportion to \\nthe reduction in money-wages (i.e. which is somewhat greater measured in wage-units). \\nBut if the classical theory is not allowed to extend by analogy its conclusions in respect \\nof a particular industry to industry as a whole, it is wholly unable to answer the question \\nwhat effect on employment a reduction in money-wages will have. For it has no method \\nof analysis wherewith to tackle the problem. Professor Pigou's Theory of Unemployment \\nseems to me to get out of the classical theory all that can be got out of it; with the result \\nthat the book becomes a striking demonstration that this theory has nothing to offer, when \\nit  is  applied  to  the  problem  of  what  determines  the  volume  of  actual  employment  as  a \\nwhole[1]. \\n\",\n",

For  whilst  the  above  fairly \\nrepresents,  I  think,  the  way  in  which  many  economists  talk  and  write,  the  underlying \\nanalysis has seldom been written down in detail. \\n',\n",
       "    'It  appears,  however,  that  this  way  of  thinking  is  probably  reached  as  follows.  In  any \\ngiven industry we have a demand schedule for the product relating the quantities which \\ncan be sold to the prices asked; we have a series of supply schedules relating the prices \\nwhich will be asked for the sale of different quantities on various bases of cost; and these \\nschedules between them lead up to a further schedule which, on the assumption that other \\ncosts  are  unchanged  (except  as  a  result  of  the  change  in  output),  gives  us  the  demand \\nschedule for labour in the industry relating the quantity of employment to different levels \\nof  wages,  the  shape  of  the  curve  at  any  point  furnishing  the  elasticity  of  demand  for \\nlabour. This conception is then transferred without substantial modification to industry as \\na whole; and it is supposed, by a parity of reasoning, that we have a demand schedule for \\nlabour in industry as a whole relating the quantity of employment to  different  levels of \\nwages.  It  is  held  that  it  makes  no  material  difference  to  this  argument  whether  it  is  in \\nterms of money-wages or of real wages. If we are thinking in terms of money-wages, we \\nmust,  of  course,  correct  for  changes  in  the  value  of  money;  but  this  leaves  the  general \\ntendency  of  the  argument  unchanged,  since  prices  certainly  do  not  change  in  exact \\nproportion to changes in money-wages. \\n',\n",
       "    \"If  this  is  the  groundwork  of  the  argument  (and,  if  it  is  not,  I  do  not  know  what  the \\ngroundwork is), surely it is fallacious. For the demand schedules for particular industries \\ncan  only  be  constructed  on  some  fixed  assumption  as  to  the  nature  of  the  demand  and \\nsupply  schedules  of  other  industries  and  as  to  the  amount  of  the  aggregate  effective \\ndemand. It is invalid, therefore, to transfer the argument to industry as a whole unless we \\nalso  transfer  our  assumption  that  the  aggregate  effective  demand  is  fixed.  Yet  this \\nassumption reduces the argument to an ignoratio elenchi. For, whilst no one would wish \\nto  deny  the  proposition  that  a  reduction  in  money-wages  accompanied  by  the  same \\naggregate effective demand as before will be associated with an increase in employment, \\nthe precise question at issue is whether the reduction in money-wages will or will not be \\naccompanied by the same aggregate effective demand as before measured in money, or, \\nat any rate, by an aggregate effective demand which is not reduced in full proportion to \\nthe reduction in money-wages (i.e. which is somewhat greater measured in wage-units). \\nBut if the classical theory is not allowed to extend by analogy its conclusions in respect \\nof a particular industry to industry as a whole, it is wholly unable to answer the question \\nwhat effect on employment a reduction in money-wages will have. For it has no method \\nof analysis wherewith to tackle the problem. Professor Pigou's Theory of Unemployment \\nseems to me to get out of the classical theory all that can be got out of it; with the result \\nthat the book becomes a striking demonstration that this theory has nothing to offer, when \\nit  is  applied  to  the  problem  of  what  determines  the  volume  of  actual  employment  as  a \\nwhole[1]. \\n\",\n",

Some  products take time to produce, so that it is practically \\nimpossible to increase the supply of them quickly. Thus, if additional demand is directed \\nto them without notice, they will show a low elasticity of employment; although it may \\nbe that, given sufficient notice, their elasticity of employment approaches unity. \\n',\n",
       "    'It is in this connection that I find the principal significance of the conception of a period \\nof production. A product, I should prefer to say[5], has a period of production n if n time-\\nunits  of  notice  of  changes  in  the  demand  for  it  have  to  be  given  if  it  is  to  offer  its \\nmaximum  elasticity  of  employment.  Obviously  consumption-goods,  taken  as  a  whole, \\nhave in this sense the longest period of production, since of every productive process they \\nconstitute  the  last  stage.  Thus  if  the  first  impulse  towards  the  increase  in  effective \\ndemand comes from an increase in consumption, the initial elasticity of employment will \\nbe  further  below  its  eventual  equilibrium-level  than  if  the  impulse  comes  from  an \\nincrease in investment. Moreover, if the increased demand is directed to products with a \\nrelatively  low  elasticity  of  employment,  a  larger  proportion  of  it  will  go  to  swell  the \\nincomes of entrepreneurs and a smaller proportion to swell the incomes of wage-earners \\nand  other  prime-cost  factors;  with  the  possible  result  that  the  repercussions  may  be \\nsomewhat less favourable to expenditure, owing to the likelihood of entrepreneurs saving \\nmore of their increment of income than wage-earners would. Nevertheless the distinction \\nbetween the two cases must not be over-stated, since a large part of the reactions will be \\nmuch the same in both[6]. \\n',\n",

On the other hand, the depletion \\nof  the  surplus  stocks  will  have  an  offsetting  effect  on  the  amount  by  which  investment \\nincreases. If we suppose that there are initially some surpluses at every point, the initial \\nelasticity  of  employment  may  approximate  to  unity;  then  after  the  stocks  have  been \\nabsorbed, but before an increased supply is coming forward at an adequate rate from the \\nearlier stages of production, the elasticity will fall away; rising again towards unity as the \\nnew  position  of  equilibrium  is  approached.

In  actual  experience  the  wage-unit  does  not \\nchange  continuously  in  terms  of  money  in  response  to  every  small  change  in  effective \\ndemand;  but  discontinuously.  These  points  of  discontinuity  are  determined  by  the \\npsychology of the workers and by the policies of employers and trade unions. In an open \\nsystem,  where  they  mean  a  change  relatively  to  wage-costs  elsewhere,  and  in  a  trade \\ncycle,  where  even  in  a  closed  system  they  may  mean  a  change  relatively  to  expected \\nwage-costs in the future, they can be of considerable practical significance. These points, \\nwhere  a  further  increase  in  effective  demand  in  terms  of  money  is  liable  to  cause  a \\ndiscontinuous rise in the wage-unit, might be deemed, from a certain point of view, to be \\npositions  of  semi-inflation,  having  some  analogy  (though  a  very  imperfect  one)  to  the \\nabsolute  inflation  which  ensues  on  an  increase  in  effective  demand  in  circumstances  of \\nfull employment.

There  is  room,  therefore,  for  both  policies  to  operate \\ntogether;—to  promote  investment  and,  at  the  same  time,  to  promote  consumption,  not \\nmerely to the level which with the existing propensity to consume would correspond to \\nthe  increased  investment,  but  to  a  higher  level  still.  If—to  take  round  figures  for  the \\npurpose of illustration—the average level of output of to-day is 15 per cent below what it \\nwould be with continuous full employment, and if 10 per cent of this output represents \\nnet investment and 90 per cent of it consumption—if, furthermore, net investment would \\nhave to rise 50 per cent in order to secure full employment with the existing propensity to \\nconsume, so that with full employment output would rise from 100 to 115, consumption \\nfrom  90  to  100  and  net  investment  from  10  to  15:—then  we  might  aim,  perhaps,  at  so \\nmodifying the propensity to consume that with full employment consumption would rise \\nfrom 90 to 103 and net investment from 10 to 12. \\n',\n",

Never  in  history  was \\nthere a method devised of such efficacy for setting each country's advantage at variance \\nwith its neighbours' as the international gold (or, formerly, silver) standard. For it made \\ndomestic  prosperity  directly  dependent  on  a  competitive  pursuit  of  markets  and  a \\ncompetitive appetite for the precious metals.

The  part  played  by  orthodox  economists, \\nwhose common sense has been insufficient to check their faulty logic, has been disastrous \\nto  the  latest  act.  For  when  in  their  blind  struggle  for  an  escape,  some  countries  have \\nthrown off the obligations which had previously rendered impossible an autonomous rate \\nof  interest,  these  economists  have  taught  that  a  restoration  of  the  former  shackles  is  a \\nnecessary first step to a general recovery. \\n\",\n",

The  part  which  derives  from  Henry  George[27],  though  doubtless  an  important \\nsource of the movement's strength, is of altogether secondary interest. The purpose of the \\nbook as a whole may be described as the establishment of an anti-Marxian socialism, a \\nreaction against laissez-faire built on theoretical foundations totally unlike those of Marx \\nin being based on a repudiation instead of on an acceptance of the classical hypotheses, \\nand on an unfettering of competition instead of its abolition. I believe that the future will \\nlearn more from the spirit of Gesell than from that of Marx.

In the first \\nplace, he distinguishes clearly between the rate of interest and the marginal efficiency of \\ncapital, and he argues that it is the rate of interest which sets a limit to the rate of growth \\nof  real  capital.  Next,  he  points  out  that  the  rate  of  interest  is  a  purely  monetary \\nphenomenon and that the peculiarity of money, from which flows the significance of the \\nmoney  rate  of  interest,  lies  in  the  fact  that  its  ownership  as  a  means  of  storing  wealth \\ninvolves  the  holder  in  negligible  carrying  charges,  and  that  forms  of  wealth,  such  as \\nstocks of commodities which do involve carrying charges, in fact yield a return because \\nof  the  standard  set  by  money.  He  cites  the  comparative  stability  of  the  rate  of  interest \\nthroughout  the  ages  as  evidence  that  it  cannot  depend  on  purely  physical  characters, \\ninasmuch  as  the  variation  of  the  latter  from  one  epoch  to  another  must  have  been \\nincalculably  greater  than  the  observed  changes  in  the  rate  of  interest;  i.e.  (in  my \\nterminology) the rate of interest, which depends on constant psychological characters, has \\nremained stable, whilst the widely fluctuating characters, which primarily determine the \\nschedule of the marginal efficiency of capital, have determined not the rate of interest but \\n\"],\n",

In  April  1919  Gesell  joined  the  short-lived  Soviet  cabinet  of \\nBavaria as their Minister of Finance, being subsequently tried by court-martial. The last \\ndecade of his life was spent in Berlin and Switzerland and devoted to propaganda. Gesell, \\ndrawing  to  himself  the  semi-religious  fervour  which  had  formerly  centred  round  Henry \\nGeorge, became  the  revered prophet of a cult with many thousand disciples throughout \\nthe world. The first international convention of the Swiss and German Freiland−Freigeld \\nBund and similar organisations from many countries was held in Basle in 1923. Since his \\ndeath  in  1930  much  of  the  peculiar  type  of  fervour  which  doctrines  such  as  his  are \\ncapable of exciting has been diverted to other (in my opinion less eminent) prophets. Dr \\nBuchi is the leader of the movement in England, but its literature seems to be distributed \\nfrom  San  Antonio,  Texas,  its  main  strength  lying  to-day  in  the  United  States,  where \\nProfessor  Irving  Fisher,  alone  amongst  academic  economists,  has  recognised  its \\nsignificance. \\n',\n",
       "    \"In spite of the prophetic trappings with which his devotees have decorated him, Gesell's \\nmain  book  is  written  in  cool,  scientific  language;  though  it  is  suffused  throughout  by  a \\nmore passionate, a more emotional devotion to social justice than some think decent in a \\nscientist.  The  part  which  derives  from  Henry  George[27],  though  doubtless  an  important \\nsource of the movement's strength, is of altogether secondary interest. The purpose of the \\nbook as a whole may be described as the establishment of an anti-Marxian socialism, a \\nreaction against laissez-faire built on theoretical foundations totally unlike those of Marx \\nin being based on a repudiation instead of on an acceptance of the classical hypotheses, \\nand on an unfettering of competition instead of its abolition. I believe that the future will \\nlearn more from the spirit of Gesell than from that of Marx. The preface to The Natural \\nEconomic  Order  will  indicate  to  the  reader,  if  he  will  refer  to  it,  the  moral  quality  of \\nGesell. The answer to Marxism is, I think, to be found along the lines of this preface. \\n\",\n",
       "    \"Gesell's specific contribution to the theory of money and interest is as follows. In the first \\nplace, he distinguishes clearly between the rate of interest and the marginal efficiency of \\ncapital, and he argues that it is the rate of interest which sets a limit to the rate of growth \\nof  real  capital.  Next,  he  points  out  that  the  rate  of  interest  is  a  purely  monetary \\nphenomenon and that the peculiarity of money, from which flows the significance of the \\nmoney  rate  of  interest,  lies  in  the  fact  that  its  ownership  as  a  means  of  storing  wealth \\ninvolves  the  holder  in  negligible  carrying  charges,  and  that  forms  of  wealth,  such  as \\nstocks of commodities which do involve carrying charges, in fact yield a return because \\nof  the  standard  set  by  money.  He  cites  the  comparative  stability  of  the  rate  of  interest \\nthroughout  the  ages  as  evidence  that  it  cannot  depend  on  purely  physical  characters, \\ninasmuch  as  the  variation  of  the  latter  from  one  epoch  to  another  must  have  been \\nincalculably  greater  than  the  observed  changes  in  the  rate  of  interest;  i.e.  (in  my \\nterminology) the rate of interest, which depends on constant psychological characters, has \\nremained stable, whilst the widely fluctuating characters, which primarily determine the \\nschedule of the marginal efficiency of capital, have determined not the rate of interest but \\n\"]],\n",

He shows how it is only the existence of a \\nrate  of  money  interest  which  allows  a  yield  to  be  obtained  from  lending  out  stocks  of \\ncommodities. His dialogue between Robinson Crusoe and a stranger[28] is a most excellent \\neconomic  parable—as  good  as  anything  of  the  kind  that  has  been  written—to \\ndemonstrate  this  point.  But,  having  given  the  reason  why  the  money-rate  of  interest \\nunlike most commodity rates of interest cannot be negative, he altogether overlooks the \\nneed of an explanation why the money-rate of interest is positive, and he fails to explain \\nwhy the money-rate of interest is not governed (as the classical school maintains) by the \\nstandard  set  by  the  yield  on  productive  capital.  This  is  because  the  notion  of  liquidity-\\npreference had escaped him. He has constructed only half a theory of the rate of interest. \\n\",\n",

Thus  the  prime  necessity  is  to  reduce  the \\nmoney-rate  of  interest,  and  this,  he  pointed  out,  can  be  effected  by  causing  money  to \\nincur  carrying-costs  just  like  other  stocks  of  barren  goods.  This  led  him  to  the  famous \\nprescription of 'stamped' money, with which his name is chiefly associated and which has \\nreceived  the  blessing  of  Professor  Irving  Fisher.  According  to  this  proposal  currency \\nnotes  (though  it  would  clearly  need  to  apply  as  well  to  some  forms  at  least  of  bank-\\nmoney)  would  only  retain  their  value  by  being  stamped  each  month,  like  an  insurance \\ncard, with stamps purchased at a post office.

For a long time I sought to counter his arguments by the use \\nof the orthodox economic weapons. But at length he convinced me and I \\nwent in with him to elaborate the over-saving argument in a book entitled \\nThe  Physiology  of  Industry,  which  was  published  in  1889.  This  was  the \\nfirst open step in my heretical career, and I did not in the least realise its \\nmomentous  consequences.  For  just  at  that  time  I  had  given  up  my \\nscholastic  post  and  was  opening  a  new  line  of  work  as  University \\nExtension Lecturer in Economics and Literature. The first shock came in a \\nrefusal  of  the  London  Extension  Board  to  allow  me  to  offer  courses  of \\nPolitical  Economy.  This  was  due,  I  learned,  to  the  intervention  of  an \\nEconomic  Professor  who  had  read  my  book  and  considered  it  as \\nequivalent  in  rationality  to  an  attempt  to  prove  the  flatness  of  the  earth. \\nHow could there be any limit to the amount of useful saving when every \\nitem  of  saving  went  to  increase  the  capital  structure  and  the  fund  for \\npaying  wages?  Sound  economists  could  not  fail  to  view  with  horror  an \\nargument  which  sought  to  check  the  source  of  all  industrial  progress[45]. \\nAnother  interesting  personal  experience  helped  to  bring  home  to  me  the \\nsense  of  my  iniquity.  Though  prevented  from  lecturing  on  economics  in \\nLondon,  I  had  been  allowed  by  the  greater  liberality  of  the  Oxford \\nUniversity  Extension  Movement  to  address  audiences  in  the  Provinces, \\nconfining myself to practical issues relating to working-class life. Now it \\nhappened at this time that the Charity Organisation Society was planning a \\nlecture  campaign  upon  economic  subjects  and  invited  me  to  prepare  a \\ncourse.

They \\npoint out in reply that 'if a fall of Profit is to induce people to save less, it must operate in \\none of two ways, either by inducing them to spend more or by inducing them to produce \\nless'[57]. As regards the former they argue that when profits fall the aggregate income of \\nthe community is reduced, and 'we cannot suppose that when the average rate of incomes \\nis falling, individuals will be induced to increase their rate of consumption by the fact that \\nthe  premium  upon  thrift  is  correspondingly  diminished';  whilst  as  for  the  second \\nalternative, 'it is so far from being our intention to deny that a fall of profit, due to over-\\nsupply, will check production, that the admission of the operation of this check forms the \\nvery  centre  of  our  argument'[58].  Nevertheless,  their  theory  failed  of  completeness, \\nessentially on account of their having no independent theory of the rate of interest; with \\nthe  result  that  Mr  Hobson  laid  too  much  emphasis  (especially  in  his  later  books)  on \\nunder-consumption  leading  to  over-investment,  in  the  sense  of  unprofitable  investment, \\ninstead  of  explaining  that  a  relatively  weak  propensity  to  consume  helps  to  cause \\nunemployment  by  requiring  and  not  receiving  the  accompaniment  of  a  compensating \\nvolume of new investment, which, even if it may sometimes occur temporarily through \\nerrors of optimism, is in general prevented from happening at all by the prospective profit \\nfalling below the standard set by the rate of interest. \\n\",\n",
       "    \"Since the war there has been a spate of heretical theories of under-consumption, of which \\nthose of Major Douglas are the most famous. The strength of Major Douglas's advocacy \\nhas,  of  course,  largely  depended  on  orthodoxy  having  no  valid  reply  to  much  of  his \\ndestructive criticism. On the other hand, the detail of his diagnosis, in particular the so-\\ncalled  A + B  theorem,  includes  much  mere  mystification.  If  Major  Douglas  had  limited \\nhis  B-items  to  the  financial  provisions  made  by  entrepreneurs  to  which  no  current \\nexpenditure on replacements and renewals corresponds, he would be nearer the truth. But \\neven  in  that  case  it  is  necessary  to  allow  for  the  possibility  of  these  provisions  being \\noffset  by  new  investment  in  other  directions  as  well  as  by  increased  expenditure  on \\nconsumption.  Major  Douglas  is  entitled  to  claim,  as  against  some  of  his  orthodox \\nadversaries, that he at least has not been wholly oblivious of the outstanding problem of \\nour economic system. Yet he has scarcely established an equal claim to rank—a private, \\nperhaps, but not a major in the brave army of heretics—with Mandeville, Malthus, Gesell \\nand Hobson, who, following their intuitions, have preferred to see the truth obscurely and \\nimperfectly rather than to maintain error, reached indeed with clearness and consistency \\nand by easy logic but on hypotheses inappropriate to the facts. \\n\",\n",

It is with the first \\nproblem only that I am concerned in what follows. \\n\",\n",
       "    \"The question of the influence on real wages of periods of boom and depression has a long \\nhistory. But we need not go farther back than the period of the 'eighties and 'nineties of \\nthe last century, when it was the subject of investigation by various official bodies before \\nwhich Marshall gave evidence or in the work of which he took part. I was myself brought \\nup upon the evidence he gave before the Gold and Silver Commission in 1887 and the \\nIndian Currency Committee in 1899. \\n\",\n",
       "    \"It is not always clear whether Marshall has in mind a rise in money wages associated with \\na rise in output, or one which merely reflects a change in prices (due, for example, to a \\nchange  in  the  standard  which  was  the  particular  subject  on  which  he  was  giving \\nevidence); but in some passages it is evident that he is dealing with changes in real wages \\nat times when output is expanding. It is clear, however, that his conclusion is based, not \\nlike some later arguments on à priori grounds arising out of increasing marginal cost in \\nthe  short  period,  but  on  statistical  grounds  which  showed—so  he  thought—that  in  the \\nshort  period  wages  were  stickier  than  prices.  In  his  preliminary  memorandum  for  the \\nGold  and  Silver  Commission  (Official  Papers,  p.  19)  he  wrote:  '[During  a  slow  and \\ngradual fall of prices] a powerful friction tends to prevent money wages in most trades \\nfrom  falling  as  fast  as  prices;  and  this  tends  almost  imperceptibly  to  establish  a  higher \\nstandard of living among the working classes, and to diminish the inequalities of wealth. \\nThese benefits are often ignored; but in my opinion they are often nearly as important as \\nthe  evils  which  result  from  that  gradual  fall  of  prices  which  is  sometimes  called  a \\ndepression  of  trade.'  And  when  Mr  Chaplin  asked  him  (op.  cit.,  p.  99),  'You  think  that \\nduring a period of depression the employed working classes have been getting more than \\nthey did before?' he replied, 'More than they did before, on the average.' \\n\",\n",
       "    \"Subsequently, as appears from an important letter of April 1897 (hitherto unpublished) to \\nFoxwell,  who  held  somewhat  strongly  the  opposite  opinion,  Marshall's  opinion  became \\nrather  more  tentative;  though  the  following  extract  refers  more  to  his  general  attitude \\ntowards rising prices than to their particular effect on real wages: \\n\",\n",

It is with the first \\nproblem only that I am concerned in what follows. \\n\",\n",
       "    \"The question of the influence on real wages of periods of boom and depression has a long \\nhistory. But we need not go farther back than the period of the 'eighties and 'nineties of \\nthe last century, when it was the subject of investigation by various official bodies before \\nwhich Marshall gave evidence or in the work of which he took part. I was myself brought \\nup upon the evidence he gave before the Gold and Silver Commission in 1887 and the \\nIndian Currency Committee in 1899. \\n\",\n",
       "    \"It is not always clear whether Marshall has in mind a rise in money wages associated with \\na rise in output, or one which merely reflects a change in prices (due, for example, to a \\nchange  in  the  standard  which  was  the  particular  subject  on  which  he  was  giving \\nevidence); but in some passages it is evident that he is dealing with changes in real wages \\nat times when output is expanding. It is clear, however, that his conclusion is based, not \\nlike some later arguments on à priori grounds arising out of increasing marginal cost in \\nthe  short  period,  but  on  statistical  grounds  which  showed—so  he  thought—that  in  the \\nshort  period  wages  were  stickier  than  prices.  In  his  preliminary  memorandum  for  the \\nGold  and  Silver  Commission  (Official  Papers,  p.  19)  he  wrote:  '[During  a  slow  and \\ngradual fall of prices] a powerful friction tends to prevent money wages in most trades \\nfrom  falling  as  fast  as  prices;  and  this  tends  almost  imperceptibly  to  establish  a  higher \\nstandard of living among the working classes, and to diminish the inequalities of wealth. \\nThese benefits are often ignored; but in my opinion they are often nearly as important as \\nthe  evils  which  result  from  that  gradual  fall  of  prices  which  is  sometimes  called  a \\ndepression  of  trade.'  And  when  Mr  Chaplin  asked  him  (op.  cit.,  p.  99),  'You  think  that \\nduring a period of depression the employed working classes have been getting more than \\nthey did before?' he replied, 'More than they did before, on the average.' \\n\",\n",
       "    \"Subsequently, as appears from an important letter of April 1897 (hitherto unpublished) to \\nFoxwell,  who  held  somewhat  strongly  the  opposite  opinion,  Marshall's  opinion  became \\nrather  more  tentative;  though  the  following  extract  refers  more  to  his  general  attitude \\ntowards rising prices than to their particular effect on real wages: \\n\",\n",

But  the  main \\nupshot  is  what  I  have  indicated  above,  and  Dr  Kalecki  makes,  to  the  best  of  my \\nunderstanding,  no  definite  progress  towards  explaining  why,  when  there  is  a  change  in \\nthe  ratio  of  actual  to  capacity  output,  the  corresponding  changes  in  the  degree  of  the \\nimperfection of competition should so exactly offset other changes. Nor does he explain \\nwhy  the  distribution  of  the  product  between  capital  and  labour  should  be  stable  in  the \\nlong run, beyond suggestion that changes of one kind always just serve to offset changes \\nof  another;  yet  it  is  very  surprising  that  on  balance  there  should  have  been  a  constant \\ndegree of monopoly over the last twenty years or longer.

A  monetary  economy,  we  shall  find,  is \\nessentially one in which changing views about the future are capable of influencing the \\nquantity  of  employment  and  not  merely  its  direction.  But  our  method  of  analysing  the \\neconomic behaviour of the present under the influence of changing ideas about the future \\nis one which depends on the interaction of supply and demand, and is in this way linked \\nup with our fundamental theory of value. We are thus led to a more general theory, which \\nincludes the classical theory with which we are familiar, as a special case. \\n',\n",

       "    'For  a  hundred  years  or  longer,  English  Political  Economy  has  been  dominated  by  an \\northodoxy. That is not to say that an unchanging doctrine has prevailed. On the contrary. \\nThere  has  been  a  progressive  evolution  of  the  doctrine.  But  its  presuppositions,  its \\natmosphere, its method have remained surprisingly the same, and a remarkable continuity \\nhas  been  observable  through  all  the  changes.  In  that  orthodoxy,  in  that  continuous \\ntransition,  I  was  brought  up.  I  learnt  it,  I  taught  it,  I  wrote  it.  To  those  looking  from \\noutside  I  probably  still  belong  to  it.  Subsequent  historians  of  doctrine  will  regard  this \\nbook as in essentially the same tradition. But I myself in writing it, and in other recent \\nwork which has led up to it, have felt myself to be breaking away from this orthodoxy, to \\nbe  in  strong  reaction  against  it,  to  be  escaping  from  something,  to  be  gaining  an \\nemancipation. And this state of mind on my part is the explanation of certain faults in the \\nbook, in particular its controversial note in some passages, and its air of being addressed \\ntoo much to the holders of a particular point of view and too little ad urbem et orbem. I \\nwas wanting to convince my own environment and did not address myself with sufficient \\ndirectness  to  outside  opinion.  Now  three  years  later,  having  grown  accustomed  to  my \\nnew skin and having almost forgotten the smell of my old one, I should, if I were writing \\nafresh,  endeavour  to  free  myself  from  this  fault  and  state  my  own  position  in  a  more \\nclear-cut manner. \\n',\n",
       "    \"I  say  all  this,  partly  to  explain  and  partly  to  excuse,  myself  to  French  readers.  For  in \\nFrance there has been no orthodox tradition with the same authority over contemporary \\nopinion as in my own country. In the United States the position has been much the same \\nas in England. But in France, as in the rest of Europe, there has been no such dominant \\nschool  since  the  expiry  of  the  school  of  French  Liberal  economists  who  were  in  their \\nprime twenty years ago (though they lived to so great an age, long after their influence \\nhad  passed  away,  that  it  fell  to  my  duty,  when  I  first  became  a  youthful  editor  of  the \\nEconomic Journal to write the obituaries of many of them—Levasseur, Molinari, Leroy-\\nBeaulieu).  If  Charles  Gide  had  attained  to  the  same  influence  and  authority  as  Alfred \\nMarshall,  your  position  would  have  borne  more  resemblance  to  ours.  As  it  is,  your \\neconomists are eclectic, too much (we sometimes think) without deep roots in systematic \\nthought. Perhaps this may make them more easily accessible to what I have to say. But it \\nmay also have the result that my readers will sometimes wonder what I am talking about \\nwhen I speak, with what some of my English critics consider a misuse of language, of the \\n'classical' school of thought and 'classical' economists. It may, therefore, be helpful to my \\nFrench readers if I attempt to indicate very briefly what I regard as the main differentiae \\nof my approach. \\n\",\n",

       "    'For  a  hundred  years  or  longer,  English  Political  Economy  has  been  dominated  by  an \\northodoxy. That is not to say that an unchanging doctrine has prevailed. On the contrary. \\nThere  has  been  a  progressive  evolution  of  the  doctrine.  But  its  presuppositions,  its \\natmosphere, its method have remained surprisingly the same, and a remarkable continuity \\nhas  been  observable  through  all  the  changes.  In  that  orthodoxy,  in  that  continuous \\ntransition,  I  was  brought  up.  I  learnt  it,  I  taught  it,  I  wrote  it.  To  those  looking  from \\noutside  I  probably  still  belong  to  it.  Subsequent  historians  of  doctrine  will  regard  this \\nbook as in essentially the same tradition. But I myself in writing it, and in other recent \\nwork which has led up to it, have felt myself to be breaking away from this orthodoxy, to \\nbe  in  strong  reaction  against  it,  to  be  escaping  from  something,  to  be  gaining  an \\nemancipation. And this state of mind on my part is the explanation of certain faults in the \\nbook, in particular its controversial note in some passages, and its air of being addressed \\ntoo much to the holders of a particular point of view and too little ad urbem et orbem. I \\nwas wanting to convince my own environment and did not address myself with sufficient \\ndirectness  to  outside  opinion.  Now  three  years  later,  having  grown  accustomed  to  my \\nnew skin and having almost forgotten the smell of my old one, I should, if I were writing \\nafresh,  endeavour  to  free  myself  from  this  fault  and  state  my  own  position  in  a  more \\nclear-cut manner. \\n',\n",
       "    \"I  say  all  this,  partly  to  explain  and  partly  to  excuse,  myself  to  French  readers.  For  in \\nFrance there has been no orthodox tradition with the same authority over contemporary \\nopinion as in my own country. In the United States the position has been much the same \\nas in England. But in France, as in the rest of Europe, there has been no such dominant \\nschool  since  the  expiry  of  the  school  of  French  Liberal  economists  who  were  in  their \\nprime twenty years ago (though they lived to so great an age, long after their influence \\nhad  passed  away,  that  it  fell  to  my  duty,  when  I  first  became  a  youthful  editor  of  the \\nEconomic Journal to write the obituaries of many of them—Levasseur, Molinari, Leroy-\\nBeaulieu).  If  Charles  Gide  had  attained  to  the  same  influence  and  authority  as  Alfred \\nMarshall,  your  position  would  have  borne  more  resemblance  to  ours.  As  it  is,  your \\neconomists are eclectic, too much (we sometimes think) without deep roots in systematic \\nthought. Perhaps this may make them more easily accessible to what I have to say. But it \\nmay also have the result that my readers will sometimes wonder what I am talking about \\nwhen I speak, with what some of my English critics consider a misuse of language, of the \\n'classical' school of thought and 'classical' economists. It may, therefore, be helpful to my \\nFrench readers if I attempt to indicate very briefly what I regard as the main differentiae \\nof my approach. \\n\",\n",
       "    'I have called my theory a general theory. I mean by this that I am chiefly concerned with \\nthe  behaviour  of  the  economic  system  as  a  whole,—with  aggregate  incomes,  aggregate \\nprofits, aggregate output, aggregate employment, aggregate investment, aggregate saving \\nrather  than  with  the  incomes,  profits,  output,  employment,  investment  and  saving  of \\nparticular industries, firms or individuals. And I argue that important mistakes have been \\n']],\n",

       "    \"Let me give examples of what I mean. My contention that for the system as a whole the \\namount of income which is saved, in the sense that it is not spent on current consumption, \\nis and must necessarily be exactly equal to the amount of net new investment has been \\nconsidered  a  paradox  and  has  been  the  occasion  of  widespread  controversy.  The \\nexplanation of this is undoubtedly to be found in the fact that this relationship of equality \\nbetween saving and investment, which necessarily holds good for the system as a whole, \\ndoes not hold good at all for a particular individual. There is no reason whatever why the \\nnew  investment  for  which  I  am  responsible  should  bear  any  relation  whatever  to  the \\namount  of  my  own  savings.  Quite  legitimately  we  regard  an  individual's  income  as \\nindependent  of  what  he  himself  consumes  and  invests.  But  this,  I  have  to  point  out, \\nshould  not  have  led  us  to  overlook  the  fact  that  the  demand  arising  out  of  the \\nconsumption  and  investment  of  one  individual  is  the  source  of  the  incomes  of  other \\nindividuals,  so  that  incomes  in  general  are  not  independent,  quite  the  contrary,  of  the \\ndisposition  of  individuals  to  spend  and  invest;  and  since  in  turn  the  readiness  of \\nindividuals to spend and invest depends on their incomes, a relationship is set up between \\naggregate savings and aggregate investment which can be very easily shown, beyond any \\npossibility  of  reasonable  dispute,  to  be  one  of  exact  and  necessary  equality.  Rightly \\nregarded this is a banal conclusion. But it sets in motion a train of thought from which \\nmore substantial matters follow. It is shown that, generally speaking, the actual level of \\noutput  and  employment  depends,  not  on  the  capacity  to  produce  or  on  the  pre-existing \\nlevel of incomes, but on the current decisions to produce which depend in turn on current \\ndecisions to invest and on present expectations of current and prospective consumption. \\nMoreover, as soon as we know the propensity to consume and to save (as I call it), that is \\nto  say  the  result  for  the  community  as  a  whole  of  the  individual  psychological \\ninclinations  as  to  how  to  dispose  of  given  incomes,  we  can  calculate  what  level  of \\nincomes,  and  therefore  what  level  of  output  and  employment,  is  in  profit-equilibrium \\nwith  a  given  level  of  new  investment;  out  of  which  develops  the  doctrine  of  the \\nMultiplier. Or again, it becomes evident that an increased propensity to save will ceteris \\nparibus  contract  incomes  and  output;  whilst  an  increased  inducement  to  invest  will \\nexpand  them.  We  are  thus  able  to  analyse  the  factors  which  determine  the  income  and \\noutput  of  the  system  as  a  whole;—we  have,  in  the  most  exact  sense,  a  theory  of \\nemployment. Conclusions emerge from this reasoning which are particularly relevant to \\nthe problems of public finance and public policy generally and of the trade cycle. \\n\",\n",
       "    'Another feature, especially characteristic of this book, is the theory of the rate of interest. \\nIn  recent  times  it  has  been  held  by  many  economists  that  the  rate  of  current  saving \\ndetermined  the  supply  of  free  capital,  that  the  rate  of  current  investment  governed  the \\ndemand for it, and that the rate of interest was, so to speak, the equilibrating price-factor \\ndetermined  by  the  point  of  intersection  of  the  supply  curve  of  savings  and  the  demand \\ncurve  of  investment.

So  long  as  the  classical  postulates  hold  good, \\nunemployment,  which  is  in  the  above  sense  involuntary,  cannot  occur.

Thus our assumption of a homogeneous unit \\nof  labour  involves  no  difficulties  unless  there  is  great  instability  in  the  relative \\nremuneration  of  different  labour-units;  and  even  this  difficulty  can  be  dealt  with,  if  it \\narises, by supposing a rapid liability to change in the supply of labour and the shape of \\nthe aggregate supply function. \\n',\n",

Time  usually \\nelapses,  however—and  sometimes  much  time—between  the  incurring  of  costs  by  the \\nproducer  (with  the  consumer  in  view)  and  the  purchase  of  the  output  by  the  ultimate \\nconsumer. Meanwhile the entrepreneur (including both the producer and the investor in \\nthis description) has to form the best expectations he can as to what the consumers will be \\nprepared to pay when he is ready to supply them (directly or indirectly) after the elapse of \\nwhat  may  be  a  lengthy  period;  and  he  has  no  choice  but  to  be  guided  by  these \\nexpectations[1], if he is to produce at all by processes which occupy time. \\n',\n",

The first type is concerned \\nwith the price which a manufacturer can expect to get for his 'finished' output at the time \\nwhen  he  commits  himself  to  starting  the  process  which  will  produce  it;  output  being \\n'finished' (from the point of view of the manufacturer) when it is ready to be used or to be \\nsold to a second party. The second type is concerned with what the entrepreneur can hope \\nto earn in the shape of future returns if he purchases (or, perhaps, manufactures) 'finished' \\noutput  as  an  addition  to  his  capital  equipment.  We  may  call  the  former  short-term \\nexpectation and the latter long-term expectation. \\n\",\n",

It is upon these various expectations that the amount of employment which \\nthe  firms  offer  will  depend.  The  actually  realised  results  of  the  production  and  sale  of \\noutput  will  only  be  relevant  to  employment  in  so  far  as  they  cause  a  modification  of \\nsubsequent  expectations.

       "   [\"It  has  sometimes  been  argued,  contrary  to  the  opinion  of  business  men,  that  organised \\nschemes  for  scrapping  redundant  plant  cannot  have  the  desired  effect  of  raising  prices \\nunless they apply to the whole of the redundant plant. But the concept of user cost shows \\nhow the scrapping of (say) half the redundant plant may have the effect of raising prices \\nimmediately.  For  by  bringing  the  date  of  the  absorption  of  the  redundancy  nearer,  this \\npolicy raises marginal user cost and consequently increases the current supply price. Thus \\nbusiness men would seem to have the notion of user cost implicitly in mind, though they \\ndo  not  formulate  it  distinctly.  If  the  supplementary  cost  is  heavy,  it  follows  that  the \\nmarginal user cost will be low when there is surplus equipment. Moreover, when there is \\nsurplus equipment, the marginal factor and user costs are unlikely to be much in excess of \\ntheir  average  value.  If  both  these  conditions  are  fulfilled,  the  existence  of  surplus \\nequipment is likely to lead to the entrepreneur's working at a net loss, and perhaps at a \\nheavy net loss. There will not be a sudden transition from this state of affairs to a normal \\nprofit, taking place at the moment when the redundancy is absorbed. As the redundancy \\nbecomes  less,  the  user  cost  will  gradually  increase;  and  the  excess  of  marginal  over \\naverage factor and user cost may also gradually increase. \\n\",\n",

It is supposed that a \\ndepositor and his bank can somehow contrive between them to perform an operation by \\nwhich savings can disappear into the banking system so that they are lost to investment, \\nor, contrariwise, that the banking system can make it possible for investment to occur, to \\nwhich no saving corresponds. But no one can save without acquiring an asset, whether it \\nbe  cash  or  a  debt  or  capital-goods;  and  no  one  can  acquire  an  asset  which  he  did  not \\npreviously possess, unless either an asset of equal value is newly produced or someone \\nelse parts with an asset of that value which he previously had. In the first alternative there \\nis  a  corresponding  new  investment:  in  the  second  alternative  someone  else  must  be \\ndissaving an equal sum. For his loss of wealth must be due to his consumption exceeding \\nhis income, and not to a loss on capital account through a change in the value of a capital-\\nasset, since it is not a case of his suffering a loss of value which his asset formerly had; he \\nis duly receiving the current value of his asset and yet is not retaining this value in wealth \\nof  any  form,  i.e.  he  must  be  spending  it  on  current  consumption  in  excess  of  current \\nincome. Moreover, if it is the banking system which parts with an asset, someone must be \\nparting with cash. It follows that the aggregate saving of the first individual and of others \\ntaken together must necessarily be equal to the amount of current new investment. \\n\",\n",
       "    \"The  notion  that  the  creation  of  credit  by  the  banking  system  allows  investment  to  take \\nplace to which 'no genuine saving' corresponds can only be the result of isolating one of \\nthe consequences of the increased bank-credit to the exclusion of the others. If the grant \\nof a bank credit to an entrepreneur additional to the credits already existing allows him to \\nmake  an  addition  to  current  investment  which  would  not  have  occurred  otherwise, \\nincomes will necessarily be increased and at a rate which will normally exceed the rate of \\nincreased investment. Moreover, except in  conditions of full employment, there will be \\nan increase of real income as well as of money-income. The public will exercise 'a free \\nchoice' as to the proportion in which they divide their increase of income between saving \\nand  spending;  and  it  is  impossible  that  the  intention  of  the  entrepreneur  who  has \\nborrowed in order to increase investment can become effective (except in substitution for \\ninvestment by other entrepreneurs which would have occurred otherwise) at a faster rate \\nthan the public decide to increase their savings. Moreover, the savings which result from \\nthis decision are just as genuine as any other savings. No one can be compelled to own \\nthe additional money corresponding to the new bank-credit, unless he deliberately prefers \\nto  hold  more  money  rather  than  some  other  form  of  wealth.

       "    \"The  prevalence  of  the  idea  that  saving  and  investment,  taken  in  their  straightforward \\nsense, can differ from one another, is to be explained, I think, by an optical illusion due to \\nregarding an individual depositor's relation to his bank as being a one-sided transaction, \\ninstead of seeing it as the two-sided transaction which it actually is. It is supposed that a \\ndepositor and his bank can somehow contrive between them to perform an operation by \\nwhich savings can disappear into the banking system so that they are lost to investment, \\nor, contrariwise, that the banking system can make it possible for investment to occur, to \\nwhich no saving corresponds. But no one can save without acquiring an asset, whether it \\nbe  cash  or  a  debt  or  capital-goods;  and  no  one  can  acquire  an  asset  which  he  did  not \\npreviously possess, unless either an asset of equal value is newly produced or someone \\nelse parts with an asset of that value which he previously had. In the first alternative there \\nis  a  corresponding  new  investment:  in  the  second  alternative  someone  else  must  be \\ndissaving an equal sum. For his loss of wealth must be due to his consumption exceeding \\nhis income, and not to a loss on capital account through a change in the value of a capital-\\nasset, since it is not a case of his suffering a loss of value which his asset formerly had; he \\nis duly receiving the current value of his asset and yet is not retaining this value in wealth \\nof  any  form,  i.e.  he  must  be  spending  it  on  current  consumption  in  excess  of  current \\nincome. Moreover, if it is the banking system which parts with an asset, someone must be \\nparting with cash. It follows that the aggregate saving of the first individual and of others \\ntaken together must necessarily be equal to the amount of current new investment. \\n\",\n",
       "    \"The  notion  that  the  creation  of  credit  by  the  banking  system  allows  investment  to  take \\nplace to which 'no genuine saving' corresponds can only be the result of isolating one of \\nthe consequences of the increased bank-credit to the exclusion of the others. If the grant \\nof a bank credit to an entrepreneur additional to the credits already existing allows him to \\nmake  an  addition  to  current  investment  which  would  not  have  occurred  otherwise, \\nincomes will necessarily be increased and at a rate which will normally exceed the rate of \\nincreased investment. Moreover, except in  conditions of full employment, there will be \\nan increase of real income as well as of money-income. The public will exercise 'a free \\nchoice' as to the proportion in which they divide their increase of income between saving \\nand  spending;  and  it  is  impossible  that  the  intention  of  the  entrepreneur  who  has \\nborrowed in order to increase investment can become effective (except in substitution for \\ninvestment by other entrepreneurs which would have occurred otherwise) at a faster rate \\nthan the public decide to increase their savings. Moreover, the savings which result from \\nthis decision are just as genuine as any other savings. No one can be compelled to own \\nthe additional money corresponding to the new bank-credit, unless he deliberately prefers \\nto  hold  more  money  rather  than  some  other  form  of  wealth.

It is \\nobvious that an initiative of this description only produces its full effect on employment \\nover  a  period  of  time.  I  have  found,  however,  in discussion that this obvious fact often \\ngives  rise  to  some  confusion  between  the  logical  theory  of  the  multiplier,  which  holds \\ngood continuously, without time-lag, at all moments of time, and the consequences of an \\nexpansion  in  the  capital-goods  industries  which  take  gradual  effect,  subject  to  time-lag \\nand only after an interval. \\n',\n",
       "    'The relationship between these two things can be cleared up by pointing out, firstly that \\nan unforeseen, or imperfectly foreseen, expansion in the capital-goods industries does not \\nhave an instantaneous effect of equal amount on the aggregate of investment but causes a \\ngradual increase of the latter; and, secondly, that it may cause a temporary departure of \\nthe marginal propensity to consume away from its normal value, followed, however, by a \\ngradual return to it. \\n',\n",
       "    'Thus  an  expansion  in  the  capital-goods  industries  causes  a  series  of  increments  in \\naggregate  investment  occurring  in  successive  periods  over  an  interval  of  time,  and  a \\nseries of values of the marginal propensity to consume in these successive periods which \\ndiffer both from what the values would have been if the expansion had been foreseen and \\nfrom what they will be when the community has  settled  down  to  a  new  steady  level  of \\naggregate  investment.  But  in  every  interval  of  time  the  theory  of  the  multiplier  holds \\ngood in the sense that the increment of aggregate demand is equal to the product of the \\nincrement  of  aggregate  investment  and  the  multiplier  as  determined  by  the  marginal \\npropensity to consume. \\n',\n",
       "    'The explanation of these two sets of facts can be seen most clearly by taking the extreme \\ncase  where  the  expansion  of  employment  in  the  capital-goods  industries  is  so  entirely \\nunforeseen  that  in  the  first  instance  there  is  no  increase  whatever  in  the  output  of \\nconsumption-goods.  In  this  event  the  efforts  of  those  newly  employed  in  the  capital-\\ngoods industries to consume a proportion of their increased incomes will raise the prices \\nof  consumption-goods  until  a  temporary  equilibrium  between  demand  and  supply  has \\nbeen  brought  about  partly  by  the  high  prices  causing  a  postponement  of  consumption, \\npartly  by  a  redistribution  of  income  in  favour  of  the  saving  classes  as  an  effect  of  the \\nincreased profits resulting from the higher prices, and partly by the higher prices causing \\na depletion of stocks.

On the other hand, it is \\npossible that the statistics somewhat overstate the decline in investment, which is alleged \\nto  have  fallen  off  by  more  than  75  per  cent  in  1932  compared  with  1929,  whilst  net \\n'capital  formation'  declined  by  more  than  95  per  cent;—a  moderate  change  in  these \\nestimates being capable of making a substantial difference to the multiplier.  \\n\",\n",

Professor Fisher explains that \\nthe extent of investment in any direction will depend on a comparison between the rate of \\nreturn  over  cost  and  the  rate  of  interest[4].  To  induce  new  investment  'the  rate  of  return \\nover cost must exceed the rate of interest'. 'This new magnitude (or factor) in our study \\nplays  the  central  role  on  the  investment  opportunity  side  of  interest  theory[5].'

In  the  case  of  another  important  class  of  long-term  investments, \\nnamely  public  utilities,  a  substantial  proportion  of  the  prospective  yield  is  practically \\nguaranteed  by  monopoly  privileges  coupled  with  the  right  to  charge  such  rates  as  will \\nprovide  a  certain  stipulated  margin.  Finally  there  is  a  growing  class  of  investments \\nentered  upon  by,  or  at  the  risk  of;  public  authorities,  which  are  frankly  influenced  in \\nmaking  the  investment  by  a  general  presumption  of  there  being  prospective  social \\nadvantages from the investment, whatever its commercial yield may prove to be within a \\nwide range, and without seeking to be satisfied that the mathematical expectation of the \\nyield  is  at  least  equal  to  the  current  rate  of  interest,—though  the  rate  which  the  public \\nauthority has to pay may still play a decisive part in determining the scale of investment \\noperations which it can afford. \\n',\n",

       "   ['combined with the likelihood of obsolescence with the passage of time, there are many \\nindividual  investments  of  which  the  prospective  yield  is  legitimately  dominated  by  the \\nreturns of the comparatively near future. In the case of the most important class of very \\nlong-term investments, namely buildings, the risk can be frequently transferred from the \\ninvestor to the occupier, or at least shared between them, by means of long-term contracts, \\nthe risk being outweighed in the mind of the occupier by the advantages of continuity and \\nsecurity  of  tenure.  In  the  case  of  another  important  class  of  long-term  investments, \\nnamely  public  utilities,  a  substantial  proportion  of  the  prospective  yield  is  practically \\nguaranteed  by  monopoly  privileges  coupled  with  the  right  to  charge  such  rates  as  will \\nprovide  a  certain  stipulated  margin.  Finally  there  is  a  growing  class  of  investments \\nentered  upon  by,  or  at  the  risk  of;  public  authorities,  which  are  frankly  influenced  in \\nmaking  the  investment  by  a  general  presumption  of  there  being  prospective  social \\nadvantages from the investment, whatever its commercial yield may prove to be within a \\nwide range, and without seeking to be satisfied that the mathematical expectation of the \\nyield  is  at  least  equal  to  the  current  rate  of  interest,—though  the  rate  which  the  public \\nauthority has to pay may still play a decisive part in determining the scale of investment \\noperations which it can afford. \\n',\n",

It  is  to  be noticed that Marshall  uses  the  word “capital” not  “money” and the  word “stock” not \\n“loans”;  interest  is  a  payment  for  borrowing  money,  and  “demand  for  capital”  in  this  context \\nshould mean “demand for loans of money for the purpose of buying a stock of capital-goods”. But \\nthe  equality  between  the  stock  of  capital-goods  offered  and  the  stock  demanded  will  be  brought \\nabout by the prices of capital-goods, not by the rate of interest. It is equality between the demand \\nand supply of loans of money, i.e. of debts, which is brought about by the rate of interest. \\n',\n",

Is  the  suggestion  that  a  rise  in  the  rate  of  interest  is  to  be \\nregarded, by reason of its increasing the attractiveness of working in order to save, as constituting \\na  sort  of  increase  in  real  wages  which  will  induce  the  factors  of  production  to  work  for  a  lower \\nwage? This is, I think, in Mr. D. H. Robertson’s mind in a similar context. Certainly this “would \\nnot quickly amount to much”; and an attempt to explain the actual fluctuations in the amount of \\ninvestment by means of this factor would be most implausible, indeed absurd. My rewriting of the \\nlatter  half  of  this  sentence  would  be:  “and  if  an  extensive  increase  in  the  demand  for  capital  in \\ngeneral, due to an increase in the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital, is not offset by a \\nrise in the rate of interest, the extra employment and the higher level of income, which will ensue \\nas  a  result  of  the  increased  production  of  capital-goods,  will  lead  to  an  amount  of  extra  waiting \\nwhich  in  terms  of  money  will  be  exactly  equal  to  the  value  of  the  current  increment  of  capital-\\ngoods and will, therefore, precisely provide for it.” \\n',\n",
       "    '3. Why not by a rise in the supply price of capital-goods? Suppose, for example, that the “extensive \\nincrease in the demand for capital in general” is due to a fall in the rate of interest. I would suggest \\nthat  the  sentence  should  be  rewritten:  “In  so  far,  therefore,  as  the  extensive  increase  in  the \\ndemand for capital-goods cannot be immediately met by an increase in the total stock, it will have \\nto  be held  in check  for  the time  being by  a  rise in  the supply price  of  capital-goods  sufficient to \\nkeep the marginal efficiency of capital in equilibrium with the rate of interest without there being \\nany  material change  in  the  scale  of  investment;  meanwhile  (as  always)  the  factors  of  production \\nadapted for the output of capital-goods will be used in producing those capital-goods of which the \\nmarginal efficiency is greatest in the new conditions.” \\n']],\n",

In \\neffect he attempts to deduct “from the floating credit handed over to business men through credit \\ncreations the floating capital which would have been contributed in other ways if the banks had \\nnot been there”. After these deductions have been made, the argument is one of deep obscurity. To \\nbegin with, the rentiers have an income of 1500, of which they consume 500 and save 1000; the act \\nof credit creation reduces their income to 1300, of which they consume 500 - x and save 800 + x; \\nand  x,  Prof.  Pigou  concludes,  represents  the  net  increase  of  capital  made  available  by  the  act  of \\ncredit  creation.  Is  the  entrepreneurs’  income  supposed  to  be  swollen  by  the  amount  which  they \\nborrow from the banks (after making the above deductions)? Or is it swollen by the amount, i.e. \\n200, by which the rentiers’ income is reduced? In either case, are they supposed to save the whole \\nof it?

To  provide  for  contingencies  requiring  sudden \\nexpenditure and for unforeseen opportunities of advantageous purchases, and also to hold \\nan asset of which the value is fixed in terms of money to meet a subsequent liability fixed \\nin terms of money, are further motives for holding cash. \\n',\n",

For there is no necessity \\nto  hold  idle  cash  to  bridge  over  intervals  if  it  can  be  obtained  without  difficulty  at  the \\nmoment  when  it  is  actually  required.

We  have  seen  in \\nchapter  13  that  uncertainty  as  to  the  future  course  of  the  rate  of  interest  is  the  sole \\nintelligible explanation of the type of liquidity-preference L2 which leads to the holding \\nof cash M2. It follows that a given M2 will not have a definite quantitative relation to a \\ngiven rate of interest of r;—what matters is not the absolute level of r but the degree of \\nits  divergence  from  what  is  considered  a  fairly  safe  level  of  r,  having  regard  to  those \\ncalculations of probability which are being relied on. Nevertheless, there are two reasons \\nfor expecting that, in any given state of expectation, a fall in r will be associated with an \\nincrease  in  M2.  In  the  first  place,  if  the  general  view  as  to  what  is  a  safe  level  of  r  is \\nunchanged, every fall in r reduces the market rate relatively to the 'safe' rate and therefore \\nincreases  the  risk  of  illiquidity;  and,  in  the  second  place,  every  fall  in  r  reduces  the \\ncurrent earnings from illiquidity, which are available as a sort of insurance premium to \\noffset the risk of loss on capital account, by an amount equal to the difference between \\nthe squares of the old rate of interest and the new. For example, if the rate of interest on a \\nlong-term debt is 4 per cent, it is preferable to sacrifice liquidity unless on a balance of \\nprobabilities it is feared that the long-term rate of interest may rise faster than by 4 per \\ncent  of  itself  per  annum,  i.e.  by  an  amount  greater  than  0.16  per  cent  per  annum.  If, \\nhowever, the rate of interest is already as low as 2 per cent, the running yield will only \\noffset a rise in it of as little as 0.04 per cent per annum. This, indeed, is perhaps the chief \\nobstacle to a fall in the rate of interest to a very low level. Unless reasons are believed to \\nexist why future experience will be very different from past experience, a long-term rate \\nof  interest  of  (say)  2  per  cent  leaves  more  to  fear  than  to  hope,  and  offers,  at  the  same \\ntime, a running yield which is only sufficient to offset a very small measure of fear. \\n\",\n",

       "    '     Y  \\nL1(Y)  =  ——  =   M1 \\n   V \\n',\n",
       "    'There is, of course, no reason for supposing that V is constant. Its value will depend on \\nthe character of banking and industrial organisation, on social habits, on the distribution \\nof  income  between  different  classes  and  on  the  effective  cost  of  holding  idle  cash. \\nNevertheless, if we have a short period of time in view and can safely assume no material \\nchange in any of these factors, we can treat V as nearly enough constant. \\n',\n",
       "    \"(iii)  Finally  there  is  the  question  of  the  relation  between  M2  and  r.  We  have  seen  in \\nchapter  13  that  uncertainty  as  to  the  future  course  of  the  rate  of  interest  is  the  sole \\nintelligible explanation of the type of liquidity-preference L2 which leads to the holding \\nof cash M2. It follows that a given M2 will not have a definite quantitative relation to a \\ngiven rate of interest of r;—what matters is not the absolute level of r but the degree of \\nits  divergence  from  what  is  considered  a  fairly  safe  level  of  r,  having  regard  to  those \\ncalculations of probability which are being relied on. Nevertheless, there are two reasons \\nfor expecting that, in any given state of expectation, a fall in r will be associated with an \\nincrease  in  M2.  In  the  first  place,  if  the  general  view  as  to  what  is  a  safe  level  of  r  is \\nunchanged, every fall in r reduces the market rate relatively to the 'safe' rate and therefore \\nincreases  the  risk  of  illiquidity;  and,  in  the  second  place,  every  fall  in  r  reduces  the \\ncurrent earnings from illiquidity, which are available as a sort of insurance premium to \\noffset the risk of loss on capital account, by an amount equal to the difference between \\nthe squares of the old rate of interest and the new. For example, if the rate of interest on a \\nlong-term debt is 4 per cent, it is preferable to sacrifice liquidity unless on a balance of \\nprobabilities it is feared that the long-term rate of interest may rise faster than by 4 per \\ncent  of  itself  per  annum,  i.e.  by  an  amount  greater  than  0.16  per  cent  per  annum.  If, \\nhowever, the rate of interest is already as low as 2 per cent, the running yield will only \\noffset a rise in it of as little as 0.04 per cent per annum. This, indeed, is perhaps the chief \\nobstacle to a fall in the rate of interest to a very low level. Unless reasons are believed to \\nexist why future experience will be very different from past experience, a long-term rate \\nof  interest  of  (say)  2  per  cent  leaves  more  to  fear  than  to  hope,  and  offers,  at  the  same \\ntime, a running yield which is only sufficient to offset a very small measure of fear. \\n\",\n",
       "    'It  is  evident,  then,  that  the  rate  of  interest  is  a  highly  psychological  phenomenon.  We \\nshall  find,  indeed,  in  Book  V  that  it  cannot  be  in  equilibrium  at  a  level  below  the  rate \\nwhich  corresponds  to  full  employment;  because  at  such  a  level  a  state  of  true  inflation \\nwill be produced, with the result that M1 will absorb ever-increasing quantities of cash. \\nBut  at  a  level  above  the  rate  which  corresponds  to  full  employment,  the  long-term \\nmarket-rate  of  interest  will  depend,  not  only  on  the  current  policy  of  the  monetary \\nauthority,  but  also  on  market  expectations  concerning  its  future  policy.

In  this  event  the  monetary  authority  would  have  lost  effective  control  over  the \\nrate of interest. But whilst this limiting case might become practically important in future, \\nI know of no example of it hitherto. Indeed, owing to the unwillingness of most monetary \\nauthorities to deal boldly in debts of long term, there has not been much opportunity for a \\ntest. Moreover, if such a situation were to arise, it would mean that the public authority \\nitself could borrow through the banking system on an unlimited scale at a nominal rate of \\ninterest. \\n',\n",

In  Russia  and  Central  Europe  after  the  war  a  currency \\ncrisis  or  flight  from  the  currency  was  experienced,  when  no  one  could  be  induced  to \\nretain holdings either of money or of debts on any terms whatever, and even a high and \\nrising  rate  of  interest  was  unable  to  keep  pace  with  the  marginal  efficiency  of  capital \\n(especially  of  stocks  of  liquid  goods)  under  the  influence  of  the  expectation  of  an  ever \\ngreater  fall  in  the  value  of  money;  whilst  in  the  United  States  at  certain  dates  in  1932 \\nthere  was  a  crisis  of  the  opposite  kind—a  financial  crisis  or  crisis  of  liquidation,  when \\nscarcely  anyone  could  be  induced  to  part  with  holdings  of  money  on  any  reasonable \\nterms. \\n',\n",

As the pure \\nrate of interest declines it does not follow that the allowances for expense and risk decline \\npari passu.

The  creation  of  new  wealth  wholly  depends  on  the \\nprospective  yield  of  the  new  wealth  reaching  the  standard  set  by  the  current  rate  of \\ninterest. The prospective yield of the marginal new investment is not increased by the fact \\nthat  someone  wishes  to  increase  his  wealth,  since  the  prospective  yield  of  the  marginal \\nnew investment depends on the expectation of a demand for a specific article at a specific \\ndate. \\n\",\n",
       "    'Nor do we avoid this conclusion by arguing that what the owner of wealth desires is not a \\ngiven  prospective  yield  but  the  best  available  prospective  yield,  so  that  an  increased \\ndesire  to  own  wealth  reduces  the  prospective  yield  with  which  the  producers  of  new \\ninvestment  have  to  be  content.  For  this  overlooks  the  fact  that  there  is  always  an \\nalternative  to  the  ownership  of  real  capital-assets,  namely  the  ownership  of  money  and \\ndebts; so that the prospective yield with which the producers of new investment have to \\nbe  content  cannot  fall  below  the  standard  set  by  the  current  rate  of  interest.  And  the \\ncurrent rate of interest depends, as we have seen, not on the strength of the desire to hold \\nwealth,  but  on  the  strengths  of  the  desires  to  hold  it  in  liquid  and  in  illiquid  forms \\nrespectively, coupled with the amount of the supply of wealth in the one form relatively \\nto  the  supply  of  it  in  the  other.  If  the  reader  still  finds  himself  perplexed,  let  him  ask \\nhimself  why,  the  quantity  of  money  being  unchanged,  a  fresh  act  of  saving  should \\ndiminish the sum which it is desired to keep in liquid form at the existing rate of interest. \\n',\n",

If  no  change  is  expected  in  the  relative  value  of  two \\nalternative standards, then the marginal efficiency of a capital-asset will be the same in \\nwhichever of the two standards it is measured, since the numerator and denominator of \\nthe  fraction  which  leads  up  to  the  marginal  efficiency  will  be  changed  in  the  same \\nproportion. If, however, one of the alternative standards is expected to change in value in \\nterms of the other, the marginal efficiencies of capital-assets will be changed by the same \\npercentage,  according  to  which  standard  they  are  measured  in.  To  illustrate  this  let  us \\ntake  the  simplest  case  where  wheat,  one  of  the  alternative  standards,  is  expected  to \\nappreciate  at  a  steady  rate  of  a  per  cent  per  annum  in  terms  of  money;  the  marginal \\nefficiency of an asset, which is x per cent in terms of money, will then be x − a per cent in \\nterms of wheat.

The money-rate of interest, by \\nsetting the pace for all the other commodity-rates of interest, holds back investment in the \\nproduction of these other commodities without being capable of stimulating investment \\nfor the production of money, which by hypothesis cannot be produced. Moreover, owing \\nto  the  elasticity  of  demand  for  liquid  cash  in  terms  of  debts,  a  small  change  in  the \\nconditions governing this demand may not much alter the money-rate of interest, whilst \\n(apart  from  official  action)  it  is  also  impracticable,  owing  to  the  inelasticity  of  the \\nproduction  of  money,  for  natural  forces  to  bring  the  money-rate  of  interest  down  by \\naffecting  the  supply  side.  In  the  case  of  an  ordinary  commodity,  the  inelasticity  of  the \\ndemand for liquid stocks of it would enable small changes on the demand side to bring its \\nrate of interest up or down with a rush, whilst the elasticity of its supply would also tend \\nto prevent a high premium on spot over forward delivery.

Thus those reformers, who look for a remedy by creating artificial \\ncarrying-costs  for  money  through  the  device  of  requiring  legal-tender  currency  to  be \\nperiodically  stamped  at  a  prescribed  cost  in  order  to  retain  its  quality  as  money,  or  in \\nanalogous ways, have been on the right track; and the practical value of their proposals \\ndeserves consideration. \\n\",\n",
       "    \"The significance of the money-rate of interest arises, therefore, out of the combination of \\nthe characteristics that, through the working of the liquidity-motive, this rate of interest \\nmay  be  somewhat  unresponsive  to  a  change  in  the  proportion  which  the  quantity  of \\nmoney bears to other forms of wealth measured in money, and that money has (or may \\nhave)  zero  (or  negligible)  elasticities  both  of  production  and  of  substitution.  The  first \\ncondition means that demand may be predominantly directed to money, the second that \\nwhen this occurs labour cannot be employed in producing more money, and the third that \\nthere  is  no  mitigation  at  any  point  through  some  other  factor  being  capable,  if  it  is \\nsufficiently  cheap,  of  doing  money's  duty  equally  well.  The  only  relief—apart  from \\nchanges  in  the  marginal  efficiency  of  capital—can  come  (so  long  as  the  propensity \\ntowards liquidity is unchanged) from an increase in the quantity of money, or—which is \\nformally the same thing—a rise in the value of money which enables a given quantity to \\nprovide increased money-services. \\n\",\n",
       "    \"Thus a rise in the money-rate of interest retards the output of all the objects of which the \\nproduction  is  elastic  without  being  capable  of  stimulating  the  output  of  money  (the \\nproduction of which is, by hypothesis, perfectly inelastic). The money-rate of interest, by \\nsetting the pace for all the other commodity-rates of interest, holds back investment in the \\nproduction of these other commodities without being capable of stimulating investment \\nfor the production of money, which by hypothesis cannot be produced. Moreover, owing \\nto  the  elasticity  of  demand  for  liquid  cash  in  terms  of  debts,  a  small  change  in  the \\nconditions governing this demand may not much alter the money-rate of interest, whilst \\n(apart  from  official  action)  it  is  also  impracticable,  owing  to  the  inelasticity  of  the \\nproduction  of  money,  for  natural  forces  to  bring  the  money-rate  of  interest  down  by \\naffecting  the  supply  side.  In  the  case  of  an  ordinary  commodity,  the  inelasticity  of  the \\ndemand for liquid stocks of it would enable small changes on the demand side to bring its \\nrate of interest up or down with a rush, whilst the elasticity of its supply would also tend \\nto prevent a high premium on spot over forward delivery. Thus with other commodities \\nleft  to  themselves,  'natural  forces,'  i.e.  the  ordinary  forces  of  the  market,  would  tend  to \\nbring  their  rate  of  interest  down  until  the  emergence  of  full  employment  had  brought \\nabout for commodities generally the inelasticity of supply which we have postulated as a \\nnormal characteristic of money.

       "    \"In such an economy capital equipments will differ from one another (a) in the variety of \\nthe  consumables  in  the  production  of  which  they  are  capable  of  assisting,  (b)  in  the \\nstability of value of their output (in the sense in which the value of bread is more stable \\nthrough time than the value of fashionable novelties), and (c) in the rapidity with which \\nthe wealth embodied in them can  become  'liquid',  in  the sense  of  producing  output,  the \\nproceeds of which can be re-embodied if desired in quite a different form. \\n\",\n",
       "    \"The  owners  of  wealth  will  then  weigh  the  lack  of  'liquidity'  of  different  capital \\nequipments  in  the  above  sense  as  a  medium  in  which  to  hold  wealth  against  the  best \\navailable  actuarial  estimate  of  their  prospective  yields  after  allowing  for  risk.  The \\nliquidity-premium,  it  will  be  observed,  is  partly  similar  to  the  risk-premium,  but  partly \\ndifferent;—the difference corresponding to the difference between the best estimates we \\ncan make of probabilities and the confidence with which we make them[7]. When we were \\ndealing, in earlier chapters, with the estimation of prospective yield, we did not enter into \\ndetail as to how the estimation is made: and to avoid complicating the argument, we did \\nnot  distinguish  differences  in  liquidity  from  differences  in  risk  proper.

The conception of what contributes to 'liquidity' is a partly vague one, changing \\nfrom  time  to  time  and  depending  on  social  practices  and  institutions.

       "    'It would have been an advantage if the effects of a change in money-wages could have \\nbeen discussed in an earlier chapter. For the classical theory has been accustomed to rest \\nthe supposedly self-adjusting character of the economic system on an assumed fluidity of \\nmoney-wages;  and,  when  there  is  rigidity,  to  lay  on  this  rigidity  the  blame  of \\nmaladjustment. \\n',\n",
       "    'It was not possible, however, to discuss this matter fully until our own theory had been \\ndeveloped.  For  the  consequences  of  a  change  in  money-wages  are  complicated.  A \\nreduction  in  money-wages  is  quite  capable  in  certain  circumstances  of  affording  a \\nstimulus  to  output,  as  the  classical  theory  supposes.  My  difference  from  this  theory  is \\nprimarily a difference of analysis; so that it could not be set forth clearly until the reader \\nwas acquainted with my own method. \\n',\n",
       "    'The generally accepted explanation is, as I understand it, quite a simple one. It does not \\ndepend  on  roundabout  repercussions,  such  as  we  shall  discuss  below.  The  argument \\nsimply is that a reduction in money-wages will cet. par. stimulate demand by diminishing \\nthe price of the finished product, and will therefore increase output and employment up to \\nthe  point  where  the  reduction  which  labour  has  agreed  to  accept  in  its  money-wages  is \\njust  offset  by  the  diminishing  marginal  efficiency  of  labour  as  output  (from  a  given \\nequipment) is increased. \\n',\n",
       "    'In its crudest form, this is tantamount to assuming that the reduction in money-wages will \\nleave demand unaffected. There may be some economists who would maintain that there \\nis no reason why demand should be affected, arguing that aggregate demand depends on \\nthe  quantity  of  money  multiplied  by  the  income-velocity  of  money  and  that  there  is  no \\nobvious  reason  why  a  reduction  in  money-wages  would  reduce  either  the  quantity  of \\nmoney or its income-velocity. Or they may even argue that profits will necessarily go up \\nbecause  wages  have  gone  down.  But  it  would,  I  think,  be  more  usual  to  agree  that  the \\nreduction  in  money-wages  may  have  some  effect  on  aggregate  demand  through  its \\nreducing the purchasing power of some of the workers, but that the real demand of other \\nfactors,  whose  money  incomes  have  not  been  reduced,  will  be  stimulated  by  the  fall  in \\nprices,  and  that  the  aggregate  demand  of  the  workers  themselves  will  be  very  likely \\nincreased  as  a  result  of  the  increased  volume  of  employment,  unless  the  elasticity  of \\ndemand for labour in response to changes in money-wages is less than unity. Thus in the \\nnew  equilibrium  there  will  be  more  employment  than  there  would  have  been  otherwise \\nexcept, perhaps, in some unusual limiting case which has no reality in practice. \\n'],\n",

       "    'It would have been an advantage if the effects of a change in money-wages could have \\nbeen discussed in an earlier chapter. For the classical theory has been accustomed to rest \\nthe supposedly self-adjusting character of the economic system on an assumed fluidity of \\nmoney-wages;  and,  when  there  is  rigidity,  to  lay  on  this  rigidity  the  blame  of \\nmaladjustment. \\n',\n",
       "    'It was not possible, however, to discuss this matter fully until our own theory had been \\ndeveloped.  For  the  consequences  of  a  change  in  money-wages  are  complicated.  A \\nreduction  in  money-wages  is  quite  capable  in  certain  circumstances  of  affording  a \\nstimulus  to  output,  as  the  classical  theory  supposes.  My  difference  from  this  theory  is \\nprimarily a difference of analysis; so that it could not be set forth clearly until the reader \\nwas acquainted with my own method. \\n',\n",
       "    'The generally accepted explanation is, as I understand it, quite a simple one. It does not \\ndepend  on  roundabout  repercussions,  such  as  we  shall  discuss  below.  The  argument \\nsimply is that a reduction in money-wages will cet. par. stimulate demand by diminishing \\nthe price of the finished product, and will therefore increase output and employment up to \\nthe  point  where  the  reduction  which  labour  has  agreed  to  accept  in  its  money-wages  is \\njust  offset  by  the  diminishing  marginal  efficiency  of  labour  as  output  (from  a  given \\nequipment) is increased. \\n',\n",
       "    'In its crudest form, this is tantamount to assuming that the reduction in money-wages will \\nleave demand unaffected. There may be some economists who would maintain that there \\nis no reason why demand should be affected, arguing that aggregate demand depends on \\nthe  quantity  of  money  multiplied  by  the  income-velocity  of  money  and  that  there  is  no \\nobvious  reason  why  a  reduction  in  money-wages  would  reduce  either  the  quantity  of \\nmoney or its income-velocity. Or they may even argue that profits will necessarily go up \\nbecause  wages  have  gone  down.  But  it  would,  I  think,  be  more  usual  to  agree  that  the \\nreduction  in  money-wages  may  have  some  effect  on  aggregate  demand  through  its \\nreducing the purchasing power of some of the workers, but that the real demand of other \\nfactors,  whose  money  incomes  have  not  been  reduced,  will  be  stimulated  by  the  fall  in \\nprices,  and  that  the  aggregate  demand  of  the  workers  themselves  will  be  very  likely \\nincreased  as  a  result  of  the  increased  volume  of  employment,  unless  the  elasticity  of \\ndemand for labour in response to changes in money-wages is less than unity. Thus in the \\nnew  equilibrium  there  will  be  more  employment  than  there  would  have  been  otherwise \\nexcept, perhaps, in some unusual limiting case which has no reality in practice. \\n']],\n",

For if the real rate of wages ruling in the wage-goods industries is given, no \\nincreased  employment  whatever  is  possible—except,  indeed,  as  a  result  of  non-wage-\\nearners  reducing  their  consumption  of  wage-goods.  For  those  newly  engaged  in  the \\nprimary  employment  will  presumably  increase  their  consumption  of  wage-goods  which \\nwill reduce the real wage and hence (on his assumptions) lead to a withdrawal of labour \\npreviously employed elsewhere. Yet Professor Pigou accepts, apparently, the possibility \\nof increased primary employment. The line between primary and secondary employment \\nseems to be the critical psychological point at which his good common sense ceases to \\noverbear his bad theory. \\n\",\n",
       "    \"The difference in the conclusions to which the above differences in assumptions and in \\nanalysis lead can be shown by the following important passage in which Professor Pigou \\nsums  up  his  point  of  view:  'With  perfectly  free  competition  among  workpeople  and \\nlabour  perfectly  mobile,  the  nature  of  the  relation  (i.e.  between  the  real  wage-rates  for \\nwhich  people  stipulate  and  the  demand  function  for  labour)  will  be  very  simple.  There \\nwill always be at work a strong tendency for wage-rates to be so related to demand that \\neverybody is employed. Hence, in stable conditions everyone will actually be employed. \\nThe implication is that such unemployment as exists at any time is due wholly to the fact \\nthat  changes  in  demand  conditions  are  continually  taking  place  and  that  frictional \\nresistances prevent the appropriate wage adjustments from being made instantaneously.'[2]\\n\",\n",
       "    \"He concludes (op. cit. p. 253) that unemployment is primarily due to a wage policy which \\nfails to adjust itself sufficiently to changes in the real demand function for labour. Thus \\nProfessor  Pigou  believes  that  in  the  long  run  unemployment  can  be  cured  by  wage \\nadjustments[3]; whereas I maintain that the real wage (subject only to a minimum set by \\nthe marginal disutility of employment) is not primarily determined by 'wage adjustments' \\n(though  these  may  have  repercussions)  but  by  the  other  forces  of  the  system,  some  of \\nwhich  (in  particular  the  relation  between  the  schedule  of  the  marginal  efficiency  of \\ncapital and the rate of interest) Professor Pigou has failed, if I am right, to include in his \\nformal scheme. \\n\",\n",
       "    \"Finally, when Professor Pigou comes to the 'Causation of Unemployment' he speaks, it is \\ntrue,  of  fluctuations  in  the state of demand, much as I do. But  he  identifies  the  state  of \\ndemand with the Real Demand Function for Labour, forgetful of how narrow a thing the \\nlatter  is  on  his  definition.

       "   [\"Moreover,  Professor  Pigou  does  not  notice  in  this  passage  (op.  cit.  p. 75)  that  the \\nargument, which he advances against 'secondary' employment as a result of public works, \\nis,  on  the  same  assumptions,  equally  fatal  to  increased  'primary'  employment  from  the \\nsame policy. For if the real rate of wages ruling in the wage-goods industries is given, no \\nincreased  employment  whatever  is  possible—except,  indeed,  as  a  result  of  non-wage-\\nearners  reducing  their  consumption  of  wage-goods.  For  those  newly  engaged  in  the \\nprimary  employment  will  presumably  increase  their  consumption  of  wage-goods  which \\nwill reduce the real wage and hence (on his assumptions) lead to a withdrawal of labour \\npreviously employed elsewhere. Yet Professor Pigou accepts, apparently, the possibility \\nof increased primary employment. The line between primary and secondary employment \\nseems to be the critical psychological point at which his good common sense ceases to \\noverbear his bad theory. \\n\",\n",
       "    \"The difference in the conclusions to which the above differences in assumptions and in \\nanalysis lead can be shown by the following important passage in which Professor Pigou \\nsums  up  his  point  of  view:  'With  perfectly  free  competition  among  workpeople  and \\nlabour  perfectly  mobile,  the  nature  of  the  relation  (i.e.  between  the  real  wage-rates  for \\nwhich  people  stipulate  and  the  demand  function  for  labour)  will  be  very  simple.  There \\nwill always be at work a strong tendency for wage-rates to be so related to demand that \\neverybody is employed. Hence, in stable conditions everyone will actually be employed. \\nThe implication is that such unemployment as exists at any time is due wholly to the fact \\nthat  changes  in  demand  conditions  are  continually  taking  place  and  that  frictional \\nresistances prevent the appropriate wage adjustments from being made instantaneously.'[2]\\n\",\n",
       "    \"He concludes (op. cit. p. 253) that unemployment is primarily due to a wage policy which \\nfails to adjust itself sufficiently to changes in the real demand function for labour. Thus \\nProfessor  Pigou  believes  that  in  the  long  run  unemployment  can  be  cured  by  wage \\nadjustments[3]; whereas I maintain that the real wage (subject only to a minimum set by \\nthe marginal disutility of employment) is not primarily determined by 'wage adjustments' \\n(though  these  may  have  repercussions)  but  by  the  other  forces  of  the  system,  some  of \\nwhich  (in  particular  the  relation  between  the  schedule  of  the  marginal  efficiency  of \\ncapital and the rate of interest) Professor Pigou has failed, if I am right, to include in his \\nformal scheme. \\n\",\n",
       "    \"Finally, when Professor Pigou comes to the 'Causation of Unemployment' he speaks, it is \\ntrue,  of  fluctuations  in  the state of demand, much as I do. But  he  identifies  the  state  of \\ndemand with the Real Demand Function for Labour, forgetful of how narrow a thing the \\nlatter  is  on  his  definition.  For  the  Real  Demand  Function  for  Labour  depends  by \\ndefinition (as we have seen above) on nothing but two factors, namely (1) the relationship \\nin  any  given  environment  between  the  total  number  of  men  employed  and  the  number \\nwho have to be employed in the wage-goods industries to provide them with what they \\nconsume, and (2) the state of marginal productivity in the wage-goods industries.

       "    'Since we claim to have shown in the preceding chapters what determines the volume of \\nemployment  at  any  time,  it  follows,  if  we  are  right,  that  our  theory  must  be  capable  of \\nexplaining the phenomena of the trade cycle. \\n',\n",
       "    'If we examine the details of any actual instance of the trade cycle, we shall find that it is \\nhighly complex and that every element in our analysis will be required for its complete \\nexplanation. In particular we shall find that fluctuations in the propensity to consume, in \\nthe state of liquidity-preference, and in the marginal efficiency of capital have all played \\na  part.  But  I  suggest  that  the  essential  character  of  the  trade  cycle  and,  especially,  the \\nregularity  of  time-sequence  and  of  duration  which  justifies  us  in  calling  it  a  cycle,  is \\nmainly  due  to  the  way  in  which  the  marginal efficiency of capital fluctuates.

The  sudden \\ncessation  of  new  investment  after  the  crisis  will  probably  lead  to  an  accumulation  of \\nsurplus stocks of unfinished goods. The carrying-costs of these stocks will seldom be less \\nthan  10  per  cent.  per  annum.

It is against this background that \\nthe  additional  and  superimposed  effects  of  fluctuations  of  investment  in  durable  goods \\nmust be examined.

       "   ['The second stable time-factor is due to the carrying-costs of surplus stocks which force \\ntheir  absorption  within  a  certain  period,  neither  very  short  nor  very  long.  The  sudden \\ncessation  of  new  investment  after  the  crisis  will  probably  lead  to  an  accumulation  of \\nsurplus stocks of unfinished goods. The carrying-costs of these stocks will seldom be less \\nthan  10  per  cent.  per  annum.  Thus  the  fall  in  their  price  needs  to  be  sufficient  to  bring \\nabout  a  restriction  which  provides  for  their  absorption  within  a  period  of;  say,  three  to \\nfive  years  at  the  outside.  Now  the  process  of  absorbing  the  stocks  represents  negative \\ninvestment, which is a further deterrent to employment; and, when it is over, a manifest \\nrelief  will  be  experienced.  Moreover,  the  reduction  in  working  capital,  which  is \\nnecessarily attendant on the decline in output on the downward phase, represents a further \\nelement  of  disinvestment,  which  may  be  large;  and,  once  the  recession  has  begun,  this \\nexerts a strong cumulative influence in the downward direction. In the earliest phase of a \\ntypical  slump  there  will  probably  be  an  investment  in  increasing  stocks  which  helps  to \\noffset disinvestment in working-capital; in the next phase there may be a short period of \\ndisinvestment  both  in  stocks  and  in  working-capital;  after  the  lowest  point  has  been \\npassed  there  is  likely  to  be  a  further  disinvestment  in  stocks  which  partially  offsets \\nreinvestment in working-capital; and, finally, after the recovery is well on its way, both \\nfactors will be simultaneously favourable to investment. It is against this background that \\nthe  additional  and  superimposed  effects  of  fluctuations  of  investment  in  durable  goods \\nmust be examined. When a decline in this type of investment has set a cyclical fluctuation \\nin  motion  there  will  be  little  encouragement  to  a  recovery  in  such  investment  until  the \\ncycle has partly run its course[3]. \\n',\n",
       "    \"Unfortunately  a  serious  fall  in  the  marginal  efficiency  of  capital  also  tends  to  affect \\nadversely the propensity to consume. For it involves a severe decline in the market value \\nof stock exchange equities. Now, on the class who take an active interest in their stock \\nexchange  investments,  especially  if  they  are  employing  borrowed  funds,  this  naturally \\nexerts  a  very  depressing  influence.  These  people  are,  perhaps,  even  more  influenced  in \\ntheir  readiness  to  spend  by  rises  and  falls  in  the  value  of  their  investments  than  by  the \\nstate  of  their  incomes.  With  a  'stock-minded'  public  as  in  the  United  States  to-day,  a \\nrising stock-market may be an almost essential condition of a satisfactory propensity to \\nconsume;  and  this  circumstance,  generally  overlooked  until  lately,  obviously  serves  to \\naggravate  still  further  the  depressing  effect  of  a  decline  in  the  marginal  efficiency  of \\ncapital. \\n\",\n",

Thus with markets organised and influenced as they are \\nat  present,  the  market  estimation  of  the  marginal  efficiency  of  capital  may  suffer  such \\nenormously  wide  fluctuations  that  it  cannot  be  sufficiently  offset  by  corresponding \\nfluctuations in the rate of interest.

       "  'Page_212': [[\"leader of the East India Company and its most skilful advocate, discussed \\n(1668) the question of how far the legal maximum rate of interest, which \\nhe  emphatically  demanded,  would  result  in  drawing  'the  money'  of  the \\nDutch  away  from  England.  He  found  a  remedy  for  this  dreaded \\ndisadvantage in the easier transference of bills of debt, if these were used \\nas  currency,  for  this,  he  said,  'will  certainly  supply  the  defect  of  at  least \\none-half  of  all  the  ready  money  we  have  in  use  in  the  nation'.  Petty,  the \\nother writer, who was entirely unaffected by the clash of interests, was in \\nagreement with the rest when he explained the 'natural' fall in the rate of \\ninterest  from  10  per  cent  to  6  per  cent  by  the  increase  in  the  amount  of \\nmoney (Political Arithmetick, 1676), and advised lending at interest as an \\nappropriate remedy for a country with too much 'Coin' (Quantulumcunque \\nconcerning Money, 1682). \\n\",\n",
       "    'This reasoning, naturally enough, was by no means confined to England. \\nSeveral  years  later  (1701  and  1706),  for  example,  French  merchants  and \\nstatesmen  complained  of  the  prevailing  scarcity  of  coin  (disette  des \\nespèces) as the cause of the high interest rates, and they were anxious to \\nlower the rate of usury by increasing the circulation of money[7]. \\n',\n",
       "    \"The  great  Locke  was,  perhaps,  the  first  to  express  in  abstract  terms  the  relationship \\nbetween the rate of interest and the quantity of money in his controversy with Petty[8]. He \\nwas opposing Petty's proposal of a maximum rate of interest on the ground that it was as \\nimpracticable as to fix a maximum rent for land, since 'the natural Value of Money, as it \\nis apt to yield such an yearly Income by Interest, depends on the whole quantity of the \\nthen passing Money of the Kingdom, in proportion to the whole Trade of the Kingdom \\n(i.e.  the  general  Vent  of  all  the  commodities)'[9].  Locke  explains  that  money  has  two \\nvalues:  (i)  its  value  in  use  which  is  given  by  the  rate  of  interest  and  in  this  it  has  the \\nNature  of  Land,  the  Income  of  one  being  called  Rent,  of  the  other,  Use[10]',  and  (2)  its \\nvalue in exchange 'and in this it has the Nature of a Commodity', its value in exchange \\n'depending  only  on  the  Plenty  or  Scarcity  of  Money  in  proportion  to  the  Plenty  or \\nScarcity of those things and not on what Interest shall be'. Thus Locke was the parent of \\ntwin quantity theories. In the first place he held that the rate of interest depended on the \\nproportion of the quantity of money (allowing for the velocity of circulation) to the total \\nvalue of trade. In the second place he held that the value of money in exchange depended \\non  the  proportion  of  the  quantity  of  money  to  the  total  volume  of  goods  in  the  market. \\nBut—standing with one foot in the mercantilist world and with one foot in the classical \\nworld[11]—he was confused concerning the relation between these two proportions, and he \\noverlooked  altogether  the  possibility  of  fluctuations  in  liquidity-preference.  He  was, \\nhowever, eager to explain that a reduction in the rate of interest has no direct effect on the \\nprice-level  and  affects  prices  'only  as  the  Change  of  Interest  in  Trade  conduces  to  the \\nbringing in or carrying out Money or Commodity, and so in time varying their Proportion \\nhere in England from what it was before', i.e. if the reduction in the rate of interest leads \\nto the export of cash or an increase in output.

       "   [\"leader of the East India Company and its most skilful advocate, discussed \\n(1668) the question of how far the legal maximum rate of interest, which \\nhe  emphatically  demanded,  would  result  in  drawing  'the  money'  of  the \\nDutch  away  from  England.  He  found  a  remedy  for  this  dreaded \\ndisadvantage in the easier transference of bills of debt, if these were used \\nas  currency,  for  this,  he  said,  'will  certainly  supply  the  defect  of  at  least \\none-half  of  all  the  ready  money  we  have  in  use  in  the  nation'.  Petty,  the \\nother writer, who was entirely unaffected by the clash of interests, was in \\nagreement with the rest when he explained the 'natural' fall in the rate of \\ninterest  from  10  per  cent  to  6  per  cent  by  the  increase  in  the  amount  of \\nmoney (Political Arithmetick, 1676), and advised lending at interest as an \\nappropriate remedy for a country with too much 'Coin' (Quantulumcunque \\nconcerning Money, 1682). \\n\",\n",
       "    'This reasoning, naturally enough, was by no means confined to England. \\nSeveral  years  later  (1701  and  1706),  for  example,  French  merchants  and \\nstatesmen  complained  of  the  prevailing  scarcity  of  coin  (disette  des \\nespèces) as the cause of the high interest rates, and they were anxious to \\nlower the rate of usury by increasing the circulation of money[7]. \\n',\n",
       "    \"The  great  Locke  was,  perhaps,  the  first  to  express  in  abstract  terms  the  relationship \\nbetween the rate of interest and the quantity of money in his controversy with Petty[8]. He \\nwas opposing Petty's proposal of a maximum rate of interest on the ground that it was as \\nimpracticable as to fix a maximum rent for land, since 'the natural Value of Money, as it \\nis apt to yield such an yearly Income by Interest, depends on the whole quantity of the \\nthen passing Money of the Kingdom, in proportion to the whole Trade of the Kingdom \\n(i.e.  the  general  Vent  of  all  the  commodities)'[9].  Locke  explains  that  money  has  two \\nvalues:  (i)  its  value  in  use  which  is  given  by  the  rate  of  interest  and  in  this  it  has  the \\nNature  of  Land,  the  Income  of  one  being  called  Rent,  of  the  other,  Use[10]',  and  (2)  its \\nvalue in exchange 'and in this it has the Nature of a Commodity', its value in exchange \\n'depending  only  on  the  Plenty  or  Scarcity  of  Money  in  proportion  to  the  Plenty  or \\nScarcity of those things and not on what Interest shall be'.

The situation led to detailed enquiries into \\nwhere the money could have got to, the want of which was felt so bitterly. \\nNumerous attacks were directed against all persons who were supposed to \\nhave contributed either to an export (export surplus) of precious metals, or \\nto  their  disappearance  on  account  of  corresponding  activities  within  the \\ncountry[17]. \\n\",\n",

       "   [\"The best instance to my knowledge of a typically mercantilist discussion \\nof  a  state  of  affairs  of  this  kind  is  the  debates  in  the  English  House  of \\nCommons  concerning  the  scarcity  of  money,  which  occurred  in  1621, \\nwhen a serious depression had set in, particularly in the cloth export. The \\nconditions  were  described  very  clearly  by  one  of  the  most  influential \\nmembers of parliament, Sir Edwin Sandys. He stated that the farmer and \\nthe  artificer  had  to  suffer  almost  everywhere,  that  looms  were  standing \\nidle  for  want  of  money  in  the  country,  and  that  peasants  were  forced  to \\nrepudiate their contracts, 'not (thanks be to God) for want of fruits of the \\nearth, but for want of money'. The situation led to detailed enquiries into \\nwhere the money could have got to, the want of which was felt so bitterly. \\nNumerous attacks were directed against all persons who were supposed to \\nhave contributed either to an export (export surplus) of precious metals, or \\nto  their  disappearance  on  account  of  corresponding  activities  within  the \\ncountry[17]. \\n\",\n",
       "    \"Mercantilists were conscious that their policy, as Professor Heckscher puts it, 'killed two \\nbirds with one stone'. 'On the one hand the country was rid of an unwelcome surplus of \\ngoods, which was believed to result in unemployment, while on the other the total stock \\nof money in the country was increased'[18], with the resulting advantages of a fall in the \\nrate of interest. \\n\",\n",
       "    'It  is  impossible  to  study  the  notions  to  which  the  mercantilists  were  led  by  their  actual \\nexperiences, without perceiving that there has been a chronic tendency throughout human \\nhistory  for  the  propensity  to  save  to  be  stronger  than  the  inducement  to  invest.  The \\nweakness  of  the  inducement  to  invest  has  been  at  all  times  the  key  to  the  economic \\nproblem. To-day the explanation of the weakness of this inducement may chiefly lie in \\nthe  extent  of  existing  accumulations;  whereas,  formerly,  risks  and  hazards  of  all  kinds \\nmay have played a larger part. But the result is the same. The desire of, the individual to \\naugment his personal wealth by abstaining from consumption has usually been stronger \\nthan  the  inducement  to  the  entrepreneur  to  augment  the  national  wealth  by  employing \\nlabour on the construction of durable assets. \\n',\n",

'A prudent man', Bentham continues, 'will not, in these circumstances, pick out the \\ngood projects from the bad, for he will not meddle with projects at all.'[25]\\n\",\n",

Thrift, in fact, was regarded as \\nthe cause of unemployment, and for two reasons: in the first place, because real income \\nwas believed to diminish by the amount of money which did not enter into exchange, and \\nsecondly, because saving was believed to withdraw money from circulation.'[29] In 1598 \\nLaffemas  (Les  Trésors  et  richesses  pour  mettre  l'Estat  en  Splendeur)  denounced  the \\nobjectors  to  the  use  of  French  silks  on  the  ground  that  all  purchasers  of  French  luxury \\ngoods  created  a  livelihood  for  the  poor,  whereas  the  miser  caused  them  to  die  in \\ndistress'[30]. In 1662 Petty justified 'entertainments, magnificent shews, triumphal arches, \\netc.',  on  the  ground  that  their  costs  flowed  back  into  the  pockets  of  brewers,  bakers, \\ntailors,  shoemakers  and  so  forth.  Fortrey  justified  'excess  of  apparel'.  Von  Schrötter \\n(i686) deprecated sumptuary regulations and declared that he would wish that display in \\nclothing and the like were even greater. Barbon (1690) wrote that 'Prodigality is a vice \\nthat is prejudicial to the Man, but not to trade… Covetousness is a Vice, prejudicial both \\nto Man and Trade.'[31] In 1695 Cary argued that if everybody spent more, all would obtain \\nlarger incomes 'and might then live more plentifully'[32]. \\n\",\n",
       "    \"But it was by Bernard Mandeville's Fable of the Bees that Barbon's opinion was mainly \\npopularised,  a  book  convicted  as  a  nuisance  by  the  grand  jury  of  Middlesex  in  1723, \\nwhich stands out in the history of the moral sciences for its scandalous reputation. Only \\none  man  is  recorded  as  having  spoken  a  good  word  for  it,  namely  Dr  Johnson,  who \\ndeclared  that  it  did  not  puzzle  him,  but  'opened  his  eyes  into  real  life  very  much'.

It is clear that my thrift in no wise affects the total \\neconomic  thrift  of  the  community,  but  only  determines  whether  a \\nparticular portion of the total thrift shall have been exercised by myself or \\nby  somebody  else.  We  shall  show  how  the  thrift  of  one  part  of  the \\ncommunity has power to force another part to live beyond their income[52]. \\nMost modern economists deny that consumption could by any possibility \\nbe  insufficient.  Can  we  find  any  economic  force  at  work  which  might \\nincite a community to this excess, and if there be any such forces are there \\nnot efficient checks provided by the mechanism of commerce? It will be \\nshown,  firstly,  that  in  every  highly  organised  industrial  society  there  is \\nconstantly  at  work  a  force  which  naturally  operates  to  induce  excess  of \\nthrift; secondly, that the checks alleged to be provided by the mechanism \\nof  commerce  are  either  wholly  inoperative  or  are  inadequate  to  prevent \\ngrave  commercial  evil[53].  The  brief  answer  which  Ricardo  gave  to  the \\ncontentions  of  Malthus  and  Chalmers  seems  to  have  been  accepted  as \\nsufficient  by  most  later  economists.

There  are,  of  course,  errors  of \\nforesight; but these would not be avoided by centralising decisions. When 9,000,000 men \\nare employed out of 10,000,000 willing and able to work, there is no evidence that the \\nlabour of these 9,000,000 men is misdirected. The complaint against the present system is \\nnot  that  these  9,000,000  men  ought  to  be  employed  on  different  tasks,  but  that  tasks \\nshould be available for the remaining 1,000,000 men.

The  central  controls  necessary  to  ensure  full  employment  will,  of  course, \\ninvolve  a  large  extension  of  the  traditional  functions  of  government.  Furthermore,  the \\nmodern classical theory has itself called attention to various conditions in which the free \\nplay of economic forces may need to be curbed or guided.

Our  argument  assumed  that,  broadly  speaking,  labour  is \\nremunerated  in  terms  of  its  own  composite  product,  or  at  least  that  the  price  of  wage-\\ngoods moves in the same way as the price of output as a whole. But no one has supposed \\nthat this was strictly the case or was better than an approximation; and it may be that the \\nproportion of wage-goods, which are not the current product of the labour in question and \\nthe prices of which are not governed by the marginal cost of such product, is so great as \\nto interfere with the reliability of our approximation. House-rent and goods imported on \\nchanging terms of trade are leading examples of this factor. If in the short period rents are \\nconstant and the terms of trade tend to improve when money wages rise and to deteriorate \\nwhen money wages fall, our conclusion will be upset in practice in spite of the rest of our \\npremises holding good. \\n',\n",

For  whereas  rents,  being  largely  fixed,  rise  and  fall  less  than \\nmoney wages, the price of imported food-stuffs tends to rise more than money wages in \\nperiods of activity and to fall more in periods of depression.

If  it  should  appear  that  Increasing  output  as  such  has  a  tendency  to  decrease \\nunit-profit, it would follow that the policy suggested above is actual as well as professed. \\nIf,  however,  the  decline  in  unit-profit  appears  to  be  mainly  the  result  of  a  tendency  of \\nprices to offset higher costs incompletely, irrespective of changes in the level of output, \\nthen we have merely an example of the stickiness of prices arising out of the imperfection \\nof  competition  intrinsic  to  the  market  conditions.  Unfortunately  it  is  often  difficult  or \\nimpossible to distinguish clearly between the effects of the two influences, since higher \\nmoney costs and increasing output will generally go together. \\n',\n",
